      "[('Trump Immigration Speech 8-31-16.txt', \"Wow. Thank you. That's a lot of people, Phoenix, that's a lot of people.\\n\\nThank you very much.\\n\\nThank you, Phoenix. I am so glad to be back in Arizona.\\n\\nThe state that has a very, very special place in my heart. I love people of Arizona and together we are going to win the White House in November.\\n\\nNow, you know this is where it all began for me. Remember that massive crowd also. So, I said let's go and have some fun tonight. We're going to Arizona, OK?\\n\\nThis will be a little bit different. This won't be a rally speech, per se. Instead, I'm going to deliver a detailed policy address on one of the greatest challenges facing our country today, illegal immigration.\\n\\nI've just landed having returned from a very important and special meeting with the President of Mexico, a man I like and respect very much. And a man who truly loves his country, Mexico.\\n\\nAnd, by the way, just like I am a man who loves my country, the United States.\\n\\nWe agree on the importance of ending the illegal flow of drugs, cash, guns, and people across our border, and to put the cartels out of business.\\n\\nWe also discussed the great contributions of Mexican-American citizens to our two countries, my love for the people of Mexico, and the leadership and friendship between Mexico and the United States. It was a thoughtful and substantive conversation and it will go on for awhile. And, in the end we're all going to win. Both countries, we're all going to win.\\n\\n\\nThis is the first of what I expect will be many, many conversations. And, in a Trump administration we're going to go about creating a new relationship between our two countries, but it's going to be a fair relationship. We want fairness.\\n\\nBut to fix our immigration system, we must change our leadership in Washington and we must change it quickly.\\n\\nSadly, sadly there is no other way. The truth is our immigration system is worse than anybody ever realized. But the facts aren't known because the media won't report on them. The politicians won't talk about them and the special interests spend a lot of money trying to cover them up because they are making an absolute fortune. That's the way it is.\\n\\nToday, on a very complicated and very difficult subject, you will get the truth. The fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is that it serves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists and powerful, powerful politicians. It's all you can do. Thank you. Thank you.\\n\\nLet me tell you who it does not serve. It does not serve you the American people. Doesn't serve you. When politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following, amnesty, open borders, lower wages. Immigration reform should mean something else entirely. It should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens.\\n\\nThank you. But if we're going to make our immigration system work, then we have to be prepared to talk honestly and without fear about these important and very sensitive issues. For instance, we have to listen to the concerns that working people, our forgotten working people, have over the record pace of immigration and it's impact on their jobs, wages, housing, schools, tax bills and general living conditions.\\n\\nThese are valid concerns expressed by decent and patriotic citizens from all backgrounds, all over. We also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate. Sometimes it's just not going to work out. It's our right, as a sovereign nation to chose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish and love us.\\n\\nThen there is the issue of security. Countless innocent American lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws like they have to be enforced. I have met with many of the great parents who lost their children to sanctuary cities and open borders. So many people, so many, many people. So sad. They will be joining me on this stage in a little while and I look forward to introducing, these are amazing, amazing people.\\n\\nCountless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this administration and the administration that causes this horrible, horrible thought process, called Hillary Clinton.\\n\\nThis includes incredible Americans like 21 year old Sarah Root. The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered Federal custody and then was released into the U.S., think of it, into the U.S. community under the policies of the White House Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Weak, weak policies. Weak and foolish policies.\\n\\nHe was released again after the crime, and now he's out there at large. Sarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top student in her class one day before her death.\\n\\nAlso among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open borders policy was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21-year-old convenience store clerk and a really good guy from Mesa, Arizona. A lot of you have known about Grant. \\n\\nHe was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary, who had also been released from federal custody, and they knew it was going to happen again.\\n\\nAnother victim is Kate Steinle. Gunned down in the sanctuary city of San Francisco, by an illegal immigrant, deported five previous times. And they knew he was no good.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen there is the case of 90-year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home, 90 years old and defenseless. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records a mile long, who did not meet Obama administration standards for removal. And they knew it was going to happen.\\n\\nIn California, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran, a great woman, according to everybody that knew her, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions but was never, ever deported, despite the fact that everybody wanted him out.\\n\\nA 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens, in our prisons and jails together, had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names, 25,000.\\n\\nOn top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion dollars a year.\\n\\nAnd this is what we get. For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next 10 years, we could provide 1 million at-risk students with a school voucher, which so many people are wanting.\\n\\nWhile there are many illegal immigrants in our country who are good people, many, many, this doesn't change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower skilled workers with less education, who compete directly against vulnerable American workers, and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they can ever possibly pay back.\\n\\nAnd they're hurting a lot of our people that cannot get jobs under any circumstances.\\n\\nBut these facts are never reported. Instead, the media and my opponent discuss one thing and only one thing, the needs of people living here illegally. In many cases, by the way, they're treated better than our vets.\\n\\nNot going to happen anymore, folks. November 8th. Not going to happen anymore.\\n\\nThe truth is, the central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants or however many there may be -- and honestly we've been hearing that number for years. It's always 11 million.\\n\\nOur government has no idea. It could be 3 million. It could be 30 million. They have no idea what the number is.\\n\\nFrankly our government has no idea what they're doing on many, many fronts, folks.\\n\\nBut whatever the number, that's never really been the central issue. It will never be a central issue. It doesn't matter from that standpoint. Anyone who tells you that the core issue is the needs of those living here illegally has simply spent too much time in Washington.\\n\\nOnly the out of touch media elites think the biggest problems facing America -- you know this, this is what they talk about, facing American society today is that there are 11 million illegal immigrants who don't have legal status. And, they also think the biggest thing, and you know this, it's not nuclear, and it's not ISIS, it's not Russia, it's not China, it's global warming.\\n\\nTo all the politicians, donors, and special interests, hear these words from me and all of you today. There is only one core issue in the immigration debate, and that issue is the well being of the American people.\\n\\nNothing even comes a close second. Hillary Clinton, for instance, talks constantly about her fears that families will be separated, but she's not talking about the American families who have been permanently separated from their loved ones because of a preventable homicide, because of a preventable death, because of murder.\\n\\nNo, she's only talking about families who come here in violation of the law. We will treat everyone living or residing in our country with great dignity. So important.\\n\\nWe will be fair, just, and compassionate to all, but our greatest compassion must be for our American citizens.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nPresident Obama and Hillary Clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the American people to open borders, and you know it better than anybody right here in Arizona. You know it.\\n\\nPresident Obama and Hillary Clinton support sanctuary cities. They support catch and release on the border. they support visa overstays. They support the release of dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, criminals from detention. And, they support unconstitutional executive amnesty.\\n\\nHillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security, and Medicare for illegal immigrants, breaking the federal budget.\\n\\nOn top of that she promises uncontrolled, low-skilled immigration that continues to reduce jobs and wages for American workers, and especially for African-American and Hispanic workers within our country. Our citizens.\\n\\nMost incredibly, because to me this is unbelievable, we have no idea who these people are, where they come from. I always say Trojan Horse. Watch what's going to happen, folks. It's not going to be pretty.\\n\\nThis includes her plan to bring in 620,000 new refugees from Syria and that region over a short period of time. And even yesterday, when you were watching the news, you saw thousands and thousands of people coming in from Syria. What is wrong with our politicians, our leaders if we can call them that. What the hell are we doing?\\n\\nHard to believe. Hard to believe. Now that you've heard about Hillary Clinton's plan, about which she has not answered a single question, let me tell you about my plan. And do you notice --\\n\\nAnd do you notice all the time for weeks and weeks of debating my plan, debating, talking about it, what about this, what about that. They never even mentioned her plan on immigration because she doesn't want to get into the quagmire. It's a tough one, she doesn't know what she's doing except open borders and let everybody come in and destroy our country by the way.\\n\\nWhile Hillary Clinton meets only with donors and lobbyists, my plan was crafted with the input from Federal Immigration offices, very great people. Among the top immigration experts anywhere in this country, who represent workers, not corporations, very important to us.\\n\\nI also worked with lawmakers, who've led on this issue on behalf of American citizens for many years. And most importantly I've met with the people directly impacted by these policies. So important.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nNumber one, are you ready? Are you ready?\\n\\nWe will build a great wall along the southern border. \\n\\nAnd Mexico will pay for the wall.\\n\\nOne hundred percent. They don't know it yet, but they're going to pay for it. And they're great people and great leaders but they're going to pay for the wall. On day one, we will begin working on intangible, physical, tall, power, beautiful southern border wall.\\n\\nWe will use the best technology, including above and below ground sensors that's the tunnels. Remember that, above and below.\\n\\nAbove and below ground sensors. Towers, aerial surveillance and manpower to supplement the wall, find and dislocate tunnels and keep out criminal cartels and Mexico you know that, will work with us. I really believe it. Mexico will work with us. I absolutely believe it. And especially after meeting with their wonderful, wonderful president today. I really believe they want to solve this problem along with us, and I'm sure they will.\\n\\nNumber two, we are going to end catch and release. We catch them, oh go ahead. We catch them, go ahead.\\n\\nUnder my administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country and back to the country from which they came.\\n\\nAnd they'll be brought great distances. We're not dropping them right across. They learned that. President Eisenhower. They'd drop them across, right across, and they'd come back. And across.\\n\\nThen when they flew them to a long distance, all of a sudden that was the end. We will take them great distances. But we will take them to the country where they came from, OK?\\n\\nNumber three. Number three, this is the one, I think it's so great. It's hard to believe, people don't even talk about it. Zero tolerance for criminal aliens. Zero. Zero.\\n\\nZero. They don't come in here. They don't come in here.\\n\\nAccording to federal data, there are at least 2 million, 2 million, think of it, criminal aliens now inside of our country, 2 million people criminal aliens. We will begin moving them out day one. As soon as I take office. Day one. In joint operation with local, state, and federal law enforcement.\\n\\nNow, just so you understand, the police, who we all respect -- say hello to the police. Boy, they don't get the credit they deserve. I can tell you. They're great people. But the police and law enforcement, they know who these people are.\\n\\nThey live with these people. They get mocked by these people. They can't do anything about these people, and they want to. They know who these people are. Day one, my first hour in office, those people are gone.\\n\\nAnd you can call it deported if you want. The press doesn't like that term. You can call it whatever the hell you want. They're gone.\\n\\nBeyond the 2 million, and there are vast numbers of additional criminal illegal immigrants who have fled, but their days have run out in this country. The crime will stop. They're going to be gone. It will be over.\\n\\nThey're going out. They're going out fast.\\n\\nMoving forward. We will issue detainers for illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever, and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings if we even have to do that.\\n\\nWe will terminate the Obama administration's deadly, and it is deadly, non-enforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam our streets, walk around, do whatever they want to do, crime all over the place.\\n\\nThat's over. That's over, folks. That's over.\\n\\nSince 2013 alone, the Obama administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into United States communities. These are individuals encountered or identified by ICE, but who were not detained or processed for deportation because it wouldn't have been politically correct.\\n\\nMy plan also includes cooperating closely with local jurisdictions to remove criminal aliens immediately. We will restore the highly successful Secure Communities Program. Good program. We will expand and revitalize the popular 287(g) partnerships, which will help to identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails that we don't even know about.\\n\\nBoth of these programs have been recklessly gutted by this administration. And those were programs that worked.\\n\\nThis is yet one more area where we are headed in a totally opposite direction. There's no common sense, there's no brain power in our administration by our leader, or our leaders. None, none, none.\\n\\nHere’s an interesting graphic from a study published this summer on voting attitudes among people who heard incumbents use restrictive rhetoric on immigration -- tough enforcement, no amnesty, deportations -- and its affect on their own opinions.\\n\\nOn my first day in office I am also going to ask Congress to pass Kate's Law, named for Kate Steinle.\\n\\nTo ensure that criminal aliens convicted of illegal reentry receive strong mandatory minimum sentences. Strong.\\n\\nAnd then we get them out.\\n\\nAnother reform I'm proposing is the passage of legislation named for Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, to law enforcement officers recently killed by a previously deported illegal immigrant.\\n\\nThe Davis-Oliver bill will enhance cooperation with state and local authorities to ensure that criminal immigrants and terrorists are swiftly, really swiftly, identified and removed. And they will go face, believe me. They're going to go.\\n\\nWe're going to triple the number of ICE deportation officers.\\n\\nWithin ICE I am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice just like Hillary Clinton has evaded justice, OK?\\n\\nMaybe they'll be able to deport her.\\n\\nThe local police who know every one of these criminals, and they know each and every one by name, by crime, where they live, they will work so fast. And our local police will be so happy that they don't have to be abused by these thugs anymore. There's no great mystery to it, they've put up with it for years, and no finally we will turn the tables and law enforcement and our police will be allowed to clear up this dangerous and threatening mess.\\n\\nWe're also going to hire 5,000 more Border Patrol agents.\\n\\nWho gave me their endorsement, 16,500 gave me their endorsement.\\n\\nAnd put more of them on the border instead of behind desks which is good. We will expand the number of border patrol stations significantly.\\n\\nI've had a chance to spend time with these incredible law enforcement officers, and I want to take a moment to thank them. What they do is incredible.\\n\\nAnd getting their endorsement means so much to me. More to me really than I can say. Means so much. First time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate.\\n\\nNumber four, block funding for sanctuary cities. We block the funding. No more funds.\\n\\nWe will end the sanctuary cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths. Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars, and we will work with Congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist federal authorities.\\n\\nNumber five, cancel unconstitutional executive orders and enforce all immigration laws.\\n\\nWe will immediately terminate President Obama's two illegal executive amnesties in which he defied federal law and the Constitution to give amnesty to approximately five million illegal immigrants, five million.\\n\\nAnd how about all the millions that are waiting on line, going through the process legally? So unfair.\\n\\nHillary Clinton has pledged to keep both of these illegal amnesty programs, including the 2014 amnesty which has been blocked by the United States Supreme Court. Great.\\n\\nClinton has also pledged to add a third executive amnesty. And by the way, folks, she will be a disaster for our country, a disaster in so many other ways.\\n\\nAnd don't forget the Supreme Court of the United States. Don't forget that when you go to vote on November 8. And don't forget your Second Amendment. And don't forget the repeal and replacement of Obamacare.\\n\\nAnd don't forget building up our depleted military. And don't forget taking care of our vets. Don't forget our vets. They have been forgotten.\\n\\nClinton's plan would trigger a constitutional crisis unlike almost anything we have ever seen before. In effect, she would be abolishing the lawmaking powers of Congress in order to write her own laws from the Oval Office. And you see what bad judgment she has. She has seriously bad judgment.\\n\\nCan you imagine? In a Trump administration all immigration laws will be enforced, will be enforced. As with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities. But unlike this administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement. And ICE and Border Patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs the way their jobs are supposed to be done.\\n\\nAnyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation. That is what it means to have laws and to have a country. Otherwise we don't have a country.\\n\\nOur enforcement priorities will include removing criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays, public charges. That is those relying on public welfare or straining the safety net along with millions of recent illegal arrivals and overstays who've come here under this current corrupt administration.\\n\\n\\nNumber six, we are going to suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur.\\n\\nAccording to data provided by the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration, and the national interest between 9/11 and the end of 2014, at least 380 foreign born individuals were convicted in terror cases inside the United States. And even right now the largest number of people are under investigation for exactly this that we've ever had in the history of our country.\\n\\nOur country is a mess. We don't even know what to look for anymore, folks. Our country has to straighten out. And we have to straighten out fast.\\n\\nThe number is likely higher. But the administration refuses to provide this information, even to Congress. As soon as I enter office I am going to ask the Department of State, which has been brutalized by Hillary Clinton, brutalized.\\n\\nHomeland Security and the Department of Justice to begin a comprehensive review of these cases in order to develop a list of regions and countries from which immigration must be suspended until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put in place.\\n\\nI call it extreme vetting right? Extreme vetting. I want extreme. It's going to be so tough, and if somebody comes in that's fine but they're going to be good. It's extreme.\\n\\nAnd if people don't like it, we've got have a country folks. Got to have a country. Countries in which immigration will be suspended would include places like Syria and Libya. And we are going to stop the tens of thousands of people coming in from Syria. We have no idea who they are, where they come from. There's no documentation. There's no paperwork. It's going to end badly folks. It's going to end very, very badly.\\n\\nFor the price of resettling, one refugee in the United States, 12 could be resettled in a safe zone in their home region. Which I agree with 100 percent. We have to build safe zones and we'll get the money from Gulf states. We don't want to put up the money. We owe almost $20 trillion. Doubled since Obama took office, our national debt.\\n\\nBut we will get the money from Gulf states and others. We'll supervise it. We'll build safe zones which is something that I think all of us want to see.\\n\\nAnother reform, involves new screening tests for all applicants that include, and this is so important, especially if you get the right people. And we will get the right people. An ideological certification to make sure that those we are admitting to our country share our values and love our people.\\n\\nThank you. We're very proud of our country. Aren't we? Really? With all it's going through, we're very proud of our country. For instance, in the last five years, we've admitted nearly 100,000 immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan. And these two countries according to Pew Research, a majority of residents say that the barbaric practice of honor killings against women are often or sometimes justified. That's what they say.\\n\\nThat's what they say. They're justified. Right? And we're admitting them to our country. Applicants will be asked their views about honor killings, about respect for women and gays and minorities. Attitudes on radical Islam, which our President refuses to say and many other topics as part of this vetting procedure. And if we have the right people doing it, believe me, very, very few will slip through the cracks. Hopefully, none.\\n\\n\\nNumber seven, we will insure that other countries take their people back when they order them deported.\\n\\nThere are at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after they've been ordered to leave the United States. Including large numbers of violent criminals, they won't take them back. So we say, OK, we'll keep them. Not going to happen with me, not going to happen with me.\\n\\nDue to a Supreme Court decision, if these violent offenders cannot be sent home, our law enforcement officers have to release them into your communities.\\n\\nAnd by the way, the results are horrific, horrific. There are often terrible consequences, such as Casey Chadwick's tragic death in Connecticut just last year. Yet despite the existence of a law that commands the Secretary of State to stop issuing visas to these countries.\\n\\nSecretary Hillary Clinton ignored this law and refused to use this powerful tool to bring nations into compliance. And, they would comply if we would act properly.\\n\\nIn other words, if we had leaders that knew what they were doing, which we don't.\\n\\nThe result of her misconduct was the release of thousands and thousands of dangerous criminal aliens who should have been sent home to their countries. Instead we have them all over the place. Probably a couple in this room as a matter of fact, but I hope not.\\n\\nAccording to a report for the Boston Globe from the year 2008 to 2014 nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities because their home countries would not, under any circumstances, take them back. Hard to believe with the power we have. Hard to believe.\\n\\nWe're like the big bully that keeps getting beat up. You ever see that? The big bully that keeps getting beat up.\\n\\nThese 13,000 release occurred on Hillary Clinton's watch. She had the power and the duty to stop it cold, and she decided she would not do it.\\n\\nAnd, Arizona knows better than most exactly what I'm talking about.\\n\\n\\nThose released include individuals convicted of killings, sexual assaults, and some of the most heinous crimes imaginable.\\n\\nThe Boston Globe writes that a Globe review of 323 criminals released in New England from 2008 to 2012 found that as many as 30 percent committed new offenses, including rape, attempted murder, and child molestation. We take them, we take them.\\n\\nNumber eight, we will finally complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system which we need desperately. For years Congress has required biometric entry-exit visa tracking systems, but it has never been completed. The politicians are all talk, no action, never happens. Never happens.\\n\\nHillary Clinton, all talk. Unfortunately when there is action it's always the wrong decision. You ever notice? In my administration we will ensure that this system is in place. And, I will tell you, it will be on land, it will be on sea, it will be in air. We will have a proper tracking system.\\n\\nApproximately half of new illegal immigrants came on temporary visas and then never, ever left. Why should the? Nobody's telling them to leave. Stay as long as you want, we'll take care of you.\\n\\nBeyond violating our laws, visa overstays, pose -- and they really are a big problem, pose a substantial threat to national security. The 9/11 Commission said that this tracking system would be a high priority and would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials in august and September in 2001 in conducting a search for two of the 9/11 hijackers that were in the United States expired visas.\\n\\nAnd, you know what that would have meant, what that could have meant. Wouldn't that have been wonderful, right? What that could have meant?\\n\\nLast year alone nearly half a million individuals overstayed their temporary visas. Removing these overstays will be a top priority of my administration.\\n\\nIf people around the world believe they can just come on a temporary visa and never, ever leave, the Obama-Clinton policy, that's what it is, then we have a completely open border, and we no longer have a country.\\n\\nWe must send a message that visa expiration dates will be strongly enforced.\\n\\nNumber nine, we will turn off the jobs and benefits magnet.\\n\\nWe will ensure that E-Verify is used to the fullest extent possible under existing law, and we will work with Congress to strengthen and expand its use across the country.\\n\\nImmigration law doesn't exist for the purpose of keeping criminals out. It exists to protect all aspects of American life. The work site, the welfare office, the education system, and everything else.\\n\\nThat is why immigration limits are established in the first place. If we only enforced the laws against crime, then we have an open border to the entire world. We will enforce all of our immigration laws.\\n\\nAnd the same goes for government benefits. The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that 62 percent of households headed by illegal immigrants use some form of cash or non-cash welfare programs like food stamps or housing assistance.\\n\\nTremendous costs, by the way, to our country. Tremendous costs. This directly violates the federal public charge law designed to protect the United States Treasury. Those who abuse our welfare system will be priorities for immediate removal.\\n\\nNumber 10, we will reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workers, the forgotten people. Workers. We're going to take care of our workers.\\n\\nAnd by the way, and by the way, we're going to make great trade deals. We're going to renegotiate trade deals. We're going to bring our jobs back home. We're going to bring our jobs back home.\\n\\nWe have the most incompetently worked trade deals ever negotiated probably in the history of the world, and that starts with NAFTA. And now they want to go TPP, one of the great disasters.\\n\\nWe're going to bring our jobs back home. And if companies want to leave Arizona and if they want to leave other states, there's going to be a lot of trouble for them. It's not going to be so easy. There will be consequence. Remember that. There will be consequence. They're not going to be leaving, go to another country, make the product, sell it into the United States, and all we end up with is no taxes and total unemployment. It's not going to happen. There will be consequences.\\n\\nWe've admitted 59 million immigrants to the United States between 1965 and 2015. Many of these arrivals have greatly enriched our country. So true. But we now have an obligation to them and to their children to control future immigration as we are following, if you think, previous immigration waves.\\n\\nWe've had some big waves. And tremendously positive things have happened. Incredible things have happened. To ensure assimilation we want to ensure that it works. Assimilation, an important word. Integration and upward mobility.\\n\\nWithin just a few years immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records. The time has come for a new immigration commission to develop a new set of reforms to our legal immigration system in order to achieve the following goals.\\n\\nTo keep immigration levels measured by population share within historical norms. To select immigrants based on their likelihood of success in U.S. society and their ability to be financially self- sufficient.\\n\\nWe take anybody. Come on in, anybody. Just come on in. Not anymore.\\n\\nYou know, folks, it's called a two-way street. It is a two-way street, right? We need a system that serves our needs, not the needs of others. Remember, under a Trump administration it's called America first. Remember that.\\n\\nTo choose immigrants based on merit. Merit, skill, and proficiency. Doesn't that sound nice? And to establish new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first. And that in particular African- American and Latino workers who are being shut out in this process so unfairly.\\n\\nAnd Hillary Clinton is going to do nothing for the African- American worker, the Latino worker. She's going to do nothing. Give me your vote, she says, on November eighth. And then she'll say, so long, see you in four years. That's what it is.\\n\\nShe is going to do nothing. And just look at the past. She's done nothing. She's been there for 35 years. She's done nothing. And I say what do you have to lose? Choose me. Watch how good we're going to do together. Watch.\\n\\nYou watch. We want people to come into our country, but they have to come into our country legally and properly vetted, and in a manner that serves the national interest. We've been living under outdated immigration rules from decades ago. They're decades and decades old.\\n\\nTo avoid this happening in the future, I believe we should sunset our visa laws so that Congress is forced to periodically revise and revisit them to bring them up to date. They're archaic. They're ancient. We wouldn't put our entire federal budget on auto pilot for decades, so why should we do the same for the very, very complex subject of immigration?\\n\\nSo let's now talk about the big picture. These 10 steps, if rigorously followed and enforced, will accomplish more in a matter of months than our politicians have accomplished on this issue in the last 50 years. It's going to happen, folks. Because I am proudly not a politician, because I am not behold to any special interest, I've spent a lot of money on my campaign, I'll tell you. I write those checks. Nobody owns Trump.\\n\\nI will get this done for you and for your family. We'll do it right. You'll be proud of our country again. We'll do it right. We will accomplish all of the steps outlined above. And, when we do, peace and law and justice and prosperity will prevail. Crime will go down. Border crossings will plummet. Gangs will disappear.\\n\\nAnd the gangs are all over the place. And welfare use will decrease. We will have a peace dividend to spend on rebuilding America, beginning with our American inner cities. We're going to rebuild them, for once and for all.\\n\\nFor those here illegally today, who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and one route only. To return home and apply for reentry like everybody else, under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined above. Those who have left to seek entry --\\n\\nThank you. Thank you. Those who have left to seek entry under this new system -- and it will be an efficient system -- will not be awarded surplus visas, but will have to apply for entry under the immigration caps or limits that will be established in the future.\\n\\nWe will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration. We will break the cycle. There will be no amnesty.\\n\\nOur message to the world will be this. You cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the United States by illegally entering our country. Can't do it.\\n\\nThis declaration alone will help stop the crisis of illegal crossings and illegal overstays, very importantly. People will know that you can't just smuggle in, hunker down and wait to be legalized. It's not going to work that way. Those days are over.\\n\\nImportantly, in several years when we have accomplished all of our enforcement and deportation goals and truly ended illegal immigration for good, including the construction of a great wall, which we will have built in record time. And at a reasonable cost, which you never hear from the government.\\n\\nAnd the establishment of our new lawful immigration system then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain.\\n\\nThat discussion can take place only in an atmosphere in which illegal immigration is a memory of the past, no longer with us, allowing us to weigh the different options available based on the new circumstances at the time.\\n\\nRight now, however, we're in the middle of a jobs crisis, a border crisis and a terrorism crisis like never before. All energies of the federal government and the legislative process must now be focused on immigration security. That is the only conversation we should be having at this time, immigration security. Cut it off.\\n\\nWhether it's dangerous materials being smuggled across the border, terrorists entering on visas or Americans losing their jobs to foreign workers, these are the problems we must now focus on fixing. And the media needs to begin demanding to hear Hillary Clinton's answer on how her policies will affect Americans and their security.\\n\\nThese are matters of life and death for our country and its people, and we deserve answers from Hillary Clinton. And do you notice, she doesn't answer.\\n\\nShe didn't go to Louisiana. She didn't go to Mexico. She was invited.\\n\\nShe doesn't have the strength or the stamina to make America great again. Believe me.\\n\\nWhat we do know, despite the lack of media curiosity, is that Hillary Clinton promises a radical amnesty combined with a radical reduction in immigration enforcement. Just ask the Border Patrol about Hillary Clinton. You won't like what you're hearing.\\n\\nThe result will be millions more illegal immigrants; thousands of more violent, horrible crimes; and total chaos and lawlessness. That's what's going to happen, as sure as you're standing there.\\n\\nThis election, and I believe this, is our last chance to secure the border, stop illegal immigration and reform our laws to make your life better. I really believe this is it. This is our last time. November 8. November 8. You got to get out and vote on November 8.\\n\\nIt's our last chance. It's our last chance. And that includes Supreme Court justices and Second Amendment. Remember that.\\n\\nSo I want to remind everyone what we're fighting for and who we are fighting for.\\n\\nI am going to ask -- these are really special people that I've gotten to know. I’m going to ask all the Angel Moms to come join me on the stage right now. These are amazing women.\\n\\nThese are amazing people.\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nThese are amazing people, and I am not asking for their endorsement, believe me that. I just think I've gotten to know so many of them, and many more, from our group. But they are incredible people and what they're going through is incredible, and there's just no reason for it. Let's give them a really tremendous hand.\\n\\nThat's tough stuff, I will tell you. That is tough stuff. Incredible people.\\n\\nSo, now is the time for these voices to be heard. Now is the time for the media to begin asking questions on their behalf. Now is the time for all of us as one country, Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative to band together to deliver justice, and safety, and security for all Americans.\\n\\nLet's fix this horrible, horrible, problem. It can be fixed quickly. Let's our secure our border.\\n\\nLet's stop the drugs and the crime from pouring into our country. Let's protect our social security and Medicare. Let's get unemployed Americans off the welfare and back to work in their own country.\\n\\nThis has been an incredible evening. We're going to remember this evening. November 8, we have to get everybody. This is such an important state. November 8 we have to get everybody to go out and vote.\\n\\nWe're going to bring -- thank you, thank you. We're going to take our country back, folks. This is a movement. We're going to take our country back.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nThis is an incredible movement. The world is talking about it. The world is talking about it and by the way, if you haven't been looking to what's been happening at the polls over the last three or four days I think you should start looking. You should start looking.\\n\\nTogether we can save American lives, American jobs, and American futures. Together we can save America itself. Join me in this mission, we're going to make America great again.\\n\\nThank you. I love you. God bless you, everybody. God bless you. God bless you, thank you.\"), ('Trump National Prayer Breakfast.txt', 'Thank you, Mark.  So nice.  \\n  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  It’s a great honor to be here this morning.  And so many faith leaders — very, very important people to me — from across our magnificent nation, and so many leaders from all across the globe.\\nToday we continue a tradition begun by President Eisenhower some 64 years ago.  This gathering is a testament to the power of faith, and is one of the great customs of our nation, and I hope to be here seven more times with you.  (Laughter and applause.)\\nI want very much to thank our co-chairs, Senator Bowzman and Senator Coons, and all of the congressional leadership — they’re all over the place.  We have a lot of very distinguished guests.\\nAnd we have one guest who was just sworn in last night — Rex Tillerson, Secretary of State.  \\n  Going to do a great job.  Some people didn’t like Rex because he actually got along with leaders of the world.  I said, no, you have to understand, that’s a good thing.  \\n  That’s a good thing, not a bad thing.  He’s respected all over the world, and I think he’s going to go down as one of our great, great secretaries.  We appreciate it.  Thank you, thank you, Rex.  \\n\\nThank you as well to Senate Chaplain Barry Black for his moving words.  And I don’t know, Chaplain, whether or not that’s an appointed position.  Is that an appointed position?  I don’t even know if you’re a Democrat or if you’re a Republican, but I’m appointing you for another year — the hell with it.  (Laughter and applause.)  And I think it’s not even my appointment, it’s the Senate’s appointment, but we’ll talk to them.  Your son is here.  Your job is very, very secure, okay?  \\n  Thank you, Barry.  Appreciate it very much.\\nI also want to thank my great friends, though, Roma.  Where’s Roma?  Beautiful Roma Downey.  The voice of an angel.  She’s got the voice — every time I hear it, that voice is so beautiful.  Everything is so beautiful about Roma, including her husband because he’s a special, special friend, Mark Burnett — for the wonderful introduction.  So true.  So true.  I said to the agent, I’m sorry.  The only thing more — I actually got on the phone and fired him myself because he said, you don’t want to do it, it’ll never work, it’ll never, ever work.  You don’t want to do it.  I said, listen — but I really fired him after it became the number-one show.  It became so successful, and he wanted a commission, and he didn’t want to do it.  That’s what I really said.  \\n\\nBut we had tremendous success on “The Apprentice.”  And when I ran for President, I had to leave the show.  That’s when I knew for sure I was doing it.  And they hired a big, big movie star — Arnold Schwarzenegger -– to take my place.  And we know how that turned out.  \\n  The ratings went right down the tubes.  It’s been a total disaster.  And Mark will never, ever bet against Trump again.  And I want to just pray for Arnold, if we can, for those ratings, okay?  \\n\\nBut we’ve had an amazing life together, the last 14, 15 years.  And an outstanding man, and thank you very much for introducing me.  Appreciate it.  It’s a great honor.  \\n\\nI also want to thank my dear friend, Vice President Mike Pence, who has been incredible.  \\n  And incredible wife, Karen.  And every time I was in a little trouble with something, where they were questioning me, they’d say, but he picked Mike Pence — (laughter) — so he has to know what he’s doing.  And it’s true, he’s been — you know, on the scale of 0 to 10, I rate him a 12, okay?  So I want to thank you.  Thank you very much.  Apprentice it.  \\n\\nBut most importantly today, I want to thank the American people.  Your faith and prayers have sustained me and inspired me through some very, very tough times.  All around America, I have met amazing people whose words of worship and encouragement have been a constant source of strength.  What I hear most often as I travel the country are five words that never, ever fail to touch my heart.  That’s:  “I am praying for you.”  I hear it so often — “I am praying for you, Mr. President.”  \\n\\nNo one has inspired me more in my travels than the families of the United States military, men and women who have put their lives on the line every day for their country and their countrymen.  I just came back yesterday from Dover Air Force Base to join the family of Chief William “Ryan” Owens, as America’s fallen hero was returned home.  Very, very sad, but very, very beautiful.  Very, very beautiful.  His family was there.  Incredible family, loved him so much.  So devastated — he was so devastated.  But the ceremony was amazing.  He died in defense of our nation.  He gave his life in defense of our people.  Our debt to him and our debt to his family is eternal and everlasting.\\n“Greater love hath no man than this: that a man lay down his life for his friends.”  We will never forget the men and women who wear the uniform, believe me.  \\n  Thank you.  From generation to generation, their vigilance has kept our liberty alive.  Our freedom is won by their sacrifice, and our security has been earned with their sweat and blood and tears.  God has blessed this land to give us such incredible heroes and patriots.  They are very, very special, and we are going to take care of them.  \\n\\nOur soldiers understand that what matters is not party or ideology or creed, but the bonds of loyalty that link us all together as one.  America is a nation of believers.  In towns all across our land, it’s plain to see what we easily forget — so easily we forget this — that the quality of our lives is not defined by our material success, but by our spiritual success.  I will tell you that.  And I tell you that from somebody that has had material success and knows tremendous numbers of people with great material success — the most material success.  Many of those people are very, very miserable, unhappy people.  And I know a lot of people without that, but they have great families, they have great faith.  They don’t have money — at least not nearly to the extent — and they’re happy.  Those to me are the successful people, I have to tell you.  \\n\\nI was blessed to be raised in a churched home.  My mother and father taught me that to whom much is given much is expected.  I was sworn in on the very bible from which my mother would teach us as young children.  And that faith lives on in my heart every single day.\\nThe people in this room come from many, many backgrounds.  You represent so many religions and so many views.  But we are all united by our faith in our Creator and our firm knowledge that we are all equal in His eyes.  We are not just flesh and bone and blood.  We are human beings, with souls.  Our Republic was formed on the basis that freedom is not a gift from government, but that freedom is a gift from God.  \\n\\nIt was the great Thomas Jefferson who said, “The God who gave us life, gave us liberty.”  Jefferson asked, “Can the liberties of a nation be secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of God?”\\nAmong those freedoms is the right to worship according to our own beliefs.  That is why I will get rid of, and totally destroy, the Johnson Amendment and allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution.  I will do that — remember.  \\n\\nFreedom of religion is a sacred right, but it is also a right under threat all around us, and the world is under serious, serious threat in so many different ways.  And I’ve never seen it so much and so openly as since I took the position of President.  The world is in trouble, but we’re going to straighten it out.  Okay?  That’s what I do.  I fix things.  We’re going to straighten it out.  \\n  Believe me.  When you hear about the tough phone calls I’m having, don’t worry about it.  Just don’t worry about it.  \\n  They’re tough.  We have to be tough.  It’s time we’re going to be a little tough, folks.  We’re taken advantage of by every nation in the world, virtually.  It’s not going to happen anymore.  It’s not going to happen anymore.\\nWe have seen unimaginable violence carried out in the name of religion.  Acts of wanton slaughter against religious minorities.  Horrors on a scale that defy description.  Terrorism is a fundamental threat to religious freedom.  It must be stopped, and it will be stopped.  It may not be pretty for a little while.  It will be stopped.  \\n\\nWe have seen — and, by the way, General, as you know, James “Mad Dog” — I shouldn’t say it in this room — Mattis.  Now, there’s a reason they call him “Mad Dog Mattis” — he never lost a battle.  Always wins them and always wins them fast.  He’s our new Secretary of Defense who will be working with Rex.  He’s right now in South Korea, going to Japan, going to some other spots.  And I’ll tell you what, I’ve gotten to know him really well.  He’s the real deal.  We have somebody who’s the real deal working for us, and that’s what we need.  So, you watch.  You just watch.  \\n  Things will be different.\\nWe have seen peace-loving Muslims brutalized, victimized, murdered and oppressed by ISIS killers.  We have seen threats of extermination against the Jewish people.  We have seen a campaign of ISIS and genocide against Christians, where they cut off heads.  Not since the Middle Ages have we seen that.  We haven’t seen that, the cutting off of heads.  Now they cut off their heads, they drown people in steel cages.  Haven’t seen this — I haven’t seen this.  Nobody has seen this for many, many years.\\nAll nations have a moral obligation to speak out against such violence.  All nations have a duty to work together to confront it and to confront it viciously, if we have to.  So I want to express clearly today to the American people that my administration will do everything in its power to defend and protect religious liberty in our land.  America must forever remain a tolerant society where all faiths are respected, and where all of our citizens can feel safe and secure.  We have to feel safe and secure.\\nIn recent days, we have begun to take necessary action to achieve that goal.  Our nation has the most generous immigration system in the world.  But these are those and there are those that would exploit that generosity to undermine the values that we hold so dear.  We need security.  There are those who would seek to enter our country for the purpose of spreading violence or oppressing other people based upon their faith or their lifestyle.  Not right.  We will not allow a beachhead of intolerance to spread in our nation.  You look all over the world and you see what’s happening.\\nSo in the coming days, we will develop a system to help ensure that those admitted into our country fully embrace our values of religious and personal liberty, and that they reject any form of oppression and discrimination.  We want people to come into our nation, but we want people to love us and to love our values — not to hate us and to hate our values.  We will be a safe country.  We will be a free country.  And we will be a country where all citizens can practice their beliefs without fear of hostility or fear of violence.  America will flourish as long as our liberty and, in particular, our religious liberty is allowed to flourish.  \\n\\nAmerica will succeed as long as our most vulnerable citizens — and we have some that are so vulnerable — have a path to success.  And America will thrive as long as we continue to have faith in each other and faith in God.  \\n\\nThat faith in God has inspired men and women to sacrifice for the needy, to deploy to wars overseas, and to lock arms at home, to ensure equal rights for every man, woman and child in our land.  It’s that faith that sent the pilgrims across the oceans, the pioneers across the plains, and the young people all across America to chase their dreams.  They are chasing their dreams.  We are going to bring those dreams back.  As long as we have God, we are never, ever alone.  Whether it’s the soldier on the night watch or the single parent on the night shift, God will always give us solace and strength and comfort.\\nWe need to carry on and to keep carrying on.  For us here in Washington, we must never, ever stop asking God for the wisdom to serve the public according to his will.  That’s why — (applause) — thank you.  That’s why President Eisenhower and Senator Carlson had the wisdom to gather together 64 years ago to begin this truly great tradition.  But that’s not all they did together.  Let me tell you the rest of the story.  Just one year later, Senator Carlson was among the members of Congress to send to the President’s desk a joint resolution that added “under God” to our Pledge of Allegiance.  That’s a great thing.  \\n  Because that’s what we are and that is what we will always be, and that is what our people want:  one beautiful nation, under God.\\nThank you.  God bless you.  And God bless America.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  \\n\\n'), ('Trump Congressional Address.txt', 'Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and Citizens of America:\\nTonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our Nation\\'s path toward civil rights and the work that still remains.

Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need.\\nOur military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.\\nCrumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our beautiful land.\\nOur terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately, stop.\\nAnd our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity.\\nAbove all else, we will keep our promises to the American people.\\nIt\\'s been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the Nation on the progress I\\'ve made in keeping those promises.\\nSince my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others, have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.\\nThe stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in value since the election on November 8th, a record. We\\'ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of the fantastic new F-35 jet fighter, and will be saving billions more dollars on contracts all across our Government. We have placed a hiring freeze on non-military and non-essential Federal workers.\\nWe have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a 5 year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials --- and a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government.\\nWe have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job‑crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every Government agency; imposing a new rule which mandates that for every 1 new regulation, 2 old regulations must be eliminated; and stopping a regulation that threatens the future and livelihoods of our great coal miners.\\nWe have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines -- thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs -- and I\\'ve issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel.\\nWe have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.\\nWith the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a Council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.\\nTo protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime.\\nI have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread across our Nation.\\nWe will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth -- and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.\\nAt the same time, my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security. By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone. We want all Americans to succeed --- but that can\\'t happen in an environment of lawless chaos. We must restore integrity and the rule of law to our borders.\\nFor that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great wall along our southern border. It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a very effective weapon against drugs and crime.\\nAs we speak, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens. Bad ones are going out as I speak tonight and as I have promised.\\nTo any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this question: what would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or a loved one, because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?\\nOur obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States. We are also taking strong measures to protect our Nation from Radical Islamic Terrorism.\\nAccording to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home --- from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center.\\nWe have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world.\\nIt is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.\\nWe cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America -- we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.\\nThat is why my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our Nation safe -- and to keep out those who would do us harm.\\nAs promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS -- a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women, and children of all faiths and beliefs. We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.\\nI have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran\\'s ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel.\\nFinally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States Supreme Court -- from my list of 20 judges -- who will defend our Constitution. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice. To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill, and deep devotion to the law. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination.\\nTonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited.\\nNinety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.\\nOver 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps.\\nMore than 1 in 5 people in their prime working years are not working.\\nWe have the worst financial recovery in 65 years.\\nIn the last 8 years, the past Administration has put on more new debt than nearly all other Presidents combined.\\nWe\\'ve lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was approved, and we\\'ve lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.\\nOur trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion dollars.\\nAnd overseas, we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.\\nSolving these, and so many other pressing problems, will require us to work past the differences of party. It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.\\nBut to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy -- making it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much harder for companies to leave.\\nRight now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world.\\nMy economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.\\nWe must create a level playing field for American companies and workers.\\nCurrently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes -- but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them almost nothing.\\nI just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson. In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House.\\nAt our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business? They said that it\\'s good. I asked them further how they are doing with other countries, mainly international sales. They told me -- without even complaining because they have been mistreated for so long that they have become used to it -- that it is very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate. They said that in one case another country taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.\\nThey weren\\'t even asking for change. But I am.\\nI believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be FAIR TRADE.\\nThe first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that the \"abandonment of the protective policy by the American Government [will] produce want and ruin among our people.\"\\nLincoln was right -- and it is time we heeded his words. I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore.\\nI am going to bring back millions of jobs. Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration. The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers.\\nNations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others --- have a merit-based immigration system. It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon. According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America\\'s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.\\nSwitching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, will have many benefits: it will save countless dollars, raise workers\\' wages, and help struggling families --- including immigrant families --- enter the middle class.\\nI believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation\\'s security, and to restore respect for our laws.\\nIf we are guided by the well-being of American citizens then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.\\nAnother Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program --- the building of the interstate highway system. The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.\\nAmerica has spent approximately six trillion dollars in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. With this six trillion dollars we could have rebuilt our country --- twice. And maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.\\nTo launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in the infrastructure of the United States -- financed through both public and private capital --- creating millions of new jobs.\\nThis effort will be guided by two core principles: Buy American, and Hire American.\\nTonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better Healthcare.\\nMandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for America. The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do.\\nObamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits. As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone. Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his State -- it is unsustainable and collapsing.\\nOne third of counties have only one insurer on the exchanges --- leaving many Americans with no choice at all.\\nRemember when you were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?\\nWe now know that all of those promises have been broken.\\nObamacare is collapsing --- and we must act decisively to protect all Americans. Action is not a choice --- it is a necessity.\\nSo I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.\\nHere are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a better healthcare system for all Americans:\\nFirst, we should ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges.\\nSecondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts --- but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by the Government.\\nThirdly, we should give our great State Governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.\\nFourthly, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance -- and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately.\\nFinally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across State lines --- creating a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring cost way down and provide far better care.\\nEverything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing, and hope.\\nOur citizens deserve this, and so much more --- so why not join forces to finally get it done? On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and for the good of the American people.\\nMy administration wants to work with members in both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents have paid family leave, to invest in women\\'s health, and to promote clean air and clear water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.\\nTrue love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a brighter future.\\nAn incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all.\\nToday is Rare Disease day, and joining us in the gallery is a Rare Disease Survivor, Megan Crowley. Megan was diagnosed with Pompe Disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past 5.\\nOn receiving this news, Megan\\'s dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved Megan\\'s life. Today she is 20 years old -- and a sophomore at Notre Dame.\\nMegan\\'s story is about the unbounded power of a father\\'s love for a daughter.\\nBut our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan\\'s life, from reaching those in need.\\nIf we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.\\nIn fact, our children will grow up in a Nation of miracles.\\nBut to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind --- and the souls --- of every American child.\\nEducation is the civil rights issue of our time.\\nI am calling upon Members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African-American and Latino children. These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them.\\nJoining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice. But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning, with the help of a tax credit scholarship program. Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college. Later this year she will get her masters degree in social work.\\nWe want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.\\nBut to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.\\nThe murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century.\\nIn Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone --- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.\\nThis is not acceptable in our society.\\nEvery American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job.\\nBut to create this future, we must work with --- not against --- the men and women of law enforcement.\\nWe must build bridges of cooperation and trust --- not drive the wedge of disunity and division.\\nPolice and sheriffs are members of our community. They are friends and neighbors, they are mothers and fathers, sons and daughters -- and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry whether or not they\\'ll come home safe and sound.\\nWe must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.\\nAnd we must support the victims of crime.\\nI have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. The office is called VOICE --- Victims Of Immigration Crime Engagement. We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests.\\nJoining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.\\nTheir names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis.\\nJamiel\\'s 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison. Jamiel Shaw Jr. was an incredible young man, with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college where he would have excelled as a great quarterback. But he never got the chance. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a good friend of mine.\\nAlso with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis. Their husbands --- Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis --- were slain in the line of duty in California. They were pillars of their community. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.\\nSitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna. Jenna: I want you to know that your father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you.\\nTo Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica: I want you to know --- we will never stop fighting for justice. Your loved ones will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory.\\nFinally, to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war and --- if they must --- to fight and to win.\\nI am sending the Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the Defense sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.\\nMy budget will also increase funding for our veterans.\\nOur veterans have delivered for this Nation --- and now we must deliver for them.\\nThe challenges we face as a Nation are great. But our people are even greater.\\nAnd none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform.\\nWe are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U.S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William \"Ryan\" Owens. Ryan died as he lived: a warrior, and a hero --- battling against terrorism and securing our Nation.\\nI just spoke to General Mattis, who reconfirmed that, and I quote, \"Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies.\" Ryan\\'s legacy is etched into eternity. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one\\'s life for one\\'s friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom --- we will never forget him.\\nTo those allies who wonder what kind of friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform.\\nOur foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world. It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies across the globe.\\nWe strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two World Wars that dethroned fascism, and a Cold War that defeated communism.\\nBut our partners must meet their financial obligations.\\nAnd now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.\\nWe expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, or the Pacific --- to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost.\\nWe will respect historic institutions, but we will also respect the sovereign rights of nations.\\nFree nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people --- and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America. But we know that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more.\\nWe must learn from the mistakes of the past --- we have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world.\\nThe only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long process of rebuilding.\\nAmerica is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align. We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.\\nWe want peace, wherever peace can be found. America is friends today with former enemies. Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these World Wars. This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.\\nHopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free.\\nOn our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our Nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America\\'s centennial. At that celebration, the country\\'s builders and artists and inventors showed off their creations.\\nAlexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time.\\nRemington unveiled the first typewriter. An early attempt was made at electric light.\\nThomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen.\\nImagine the wonders our country could know in America\\'s 250th year.\\nThink of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people.\\nCures to illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.\\nAmerican footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.\\nMillions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect.\\nAnd streets where mothers are safe from fear -- schools where children learn in peace -- and jobs where Americans prosper and grow -- are not too much to ask.\\nWhen we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before. For all Americans.\\nThis is our vision. This is our mission.\\nBut we can only get there together.\\nWe are one people, with one destiny.\\nWe all bleed the same blood.\\nWe all salute the same flag.\\nAnd we are all made by the same God.\\nAnd when we fulfill this vision; when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began.\\nThe time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us.\\nWe just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts.\\nThe bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls.\\nAnd the confidence to turn those hopes and dreams to action.\\nFrom now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears ---\\ninspired by the future, not bound by the failures of the past ---\\nand guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.\\nI am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American Spirit. I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country. And I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment and --\\nBelieve in yourselves.\\nBelieve in your future.\\nAnd believe, once more, in America.\\nThank you, God bless you, and God Bless these United States.'), ('Trump Police Chiefs Speech.txt', 'Thank you very much. This is — great to be with people I truly feel comfortable with. Please sit down. They’ll say I didn’t get a standing ovation because they never sat down. And I say, I got one standing ovation because they never sat down. \\n\\nBut I want to thank you. I have great, great love for what you do and the way you do it. And when I’m with the police chiefs and I’m with the sheriffs of our country — and these are the big ones. These are the really big ones. I just want to thank you very much. And I thought before I spoke about what we’re really here to speak about, I would read something to you. Because you can be a lawyer, or you don’t have to be a lawyer; if you were a good student in high school or a bad student in high school, you can understand this. \\n\\nAnd it’s really incredible to me that we have a court case that’s going on so long. As you know, in Boston, we won it with a highly respected judge and a very strong opinion, but now we’re in an era that, let’s just say, they are interpreting things differently than probably 100 percent of the people in this room. I’d like to almost know, does anybody disagree when I read this.\\n \\n\\nBut I’m going to read what’s in dispute, what’s in question. And you will see this — it’s INA 212(f) 8 U.S.C. 1182(f): “Suspension of entry or imposition of restrictions by the President” — okay, now, this isn’t just me, this is for Obama, for Ronald Reagan, for the President. And this was done, very importantly, for security — something you people know more about than all of us. It was done for the security of our nation, the security of our citizens, so that people come in who aren’t going to do us harm.\\n\\nAnd that’s why it was done. And it couldn’t have been written any more precisely. It’s not like, oh, gee, we wish it were written better. It was written beautifully. So just listen, here’s what it says. This is what they’re arguing: \\n\\n\"Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens\" — okay, the entry, the entry of any aliens — \"or of any class of aliens\" — so any aliens, any class of aliens — \"into the United States\" — so the entry of people into the United States. Let’s say, just to be precise, of aliens into the United States. \\n\\nSo any time — \"whenever the President finds that the entry of any alien or any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States\" — right? So if I find, as President, that a person or group of people will be detrimental to the interests of the United States — and certainly there’s lots of examples that we have, but you shouldn’t even have them, necessarily — he may be — and \"he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary…\" Now, the only mistake is they should have said \"he or she.\" But hopefully, it won’t be a she for at least another seven years. After that, I’m all — (laughter and applause.) See? I just noticed that, actually. I just noticed it. I’m saying, whoa, this is not politically correct. It’s correct, but it’s not politically correct, you know, this is the old days.\\n\\nHe may by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary — so here it is, people coming in — suspend the entry of all aliens. Right? That’s what it says. It’s not like — again, a bad high school student would understand this. Anybody would understand this. Suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens. Okay, so you can suspend the aliens, right? You can suspend the aliens from coming in — very strong — or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\\n\\nOkay. So you can suspend, you can put restrictions, you can do whatever you want. And this is for the security of the country — which, again, you’re the chiefs, you’re the sheriffs. You understand this. \\n\\nAnd I listened to lawyers on both sides last night, and they were talking about things that had just nothing to do with it. I listened to a panel of judges, and I’ll comment on that — I will not comment on the statements made by certainly one judge. But I have to be honest that if these judges wanted to, in my opinion, help the court in terms of respect for the court, they\\'d what they should be doing. I mean, it’s so sad. \\n\\nThey should be — when you read something so simple and so beautifully written, and so perfectly written — other than the one statement, of course, having to do with he or she — but when you read something so perfectly written and so clear to anybody, and then you have lawyers and you watched — I watched last night in amazement, and I heard things that I couldn’t believe, things that really had nothing to do with what I just read. \\n\\nAnd I don’t ever want to call a court biased, so I won’t call it biased. And we haven’t had a decision yet. But courts seem to be so political, and it would be so great for our justice system if they would be able to read a statement and do what’s right. And that has to do with the security of our country, which is so important.\\n\\nRight now, we are at risk because of what happened. General Kelly is an extremely talented man and a very good man — now Secretary Kelly, Homeland Security. We are doing our job. He’s a great man.  We’re doing our job. And one of the reasons you probably heard that we did it so quickly — in fact, I said, let’s give a one-month notice, and then law enforcement — and General Kelly was so great because he said, we totally knew about it. We knew about everything. We do things well. We did things right.\\n\\nBut the law enforcement people said to me, oh, you can’t give a notice, because if you give a notice that you’re going to be really tough in one month from now, or in one week from now — I suggested a month and I said, well, what about a week? They said, no, you can’t do that, because then people are going to pour in before the toughness goes on. Do you people agree? I mean, you know more about law than anybody, law enforcement.  \\n\\nSo I wanted to give, like, a month. Then I said, well, what about a week? They said, well, then you’re going to have a whole pile of people perhaps — perhaps — with very evil intentions coming in before the restrictions. \\n\\nSo there it is, folks. It’s as plain as you can have it. I didn’t — and I was a good student. I understand things. I comprehend very well, okay? Better than I think almost anybody. And I want to tell you, I listened to a bunch of stuff last night on television that was disgraceful. It was disgraceful. Because what I just read to you is what we have, and it just can’t be written any plainer or better. And for us to be going through this — and, by the way, a highly, highly respected judge in Boston ruled very strongly in our favor. You heard that.\\n\\nIn fact, I said to my people, why don’t you use the Boston case? And there were reasons why they couldn’t use the Boston case. This one came later for various reasons. But use the Boston case. And I won’t read that, but there were statements made by that judge — who, again, highly respected — that were right on. They were perfect. They were perfect.\\n\\nSo I think it’s sad. I think it’s a sad day. I think our security is at risk today. And it will be at risk until such time as we are entitled and get what we are entitled to as citizens of this country. As chiefs, as sheriffs of this country, we want security. \\n\\nOne of the reasons I was elected was because of law and order and security. It’s one of the reasons I was elected. Also jobs and lots of other things. But I think one of the strongest reasons is security. And they’re taking away our weapons one by one, that’s what they’re doing. And you know it and I know it, and you people have been very unhappy for a long period of time. And I can read the polls maybe better than anybody because it seems that I understood the polls a lot better than many of the pollsters understood the polls — assuming they were honest polls, which I think probably many of them weren’t. I really believe that.   \\n\\nBut we need security in our country. We have to allow you folks to do your job. You’re great people, great people. Great men and women. And we have to allow you to do your job. And we have to give you the weapons that you need. And this is a weapon that you need. And they’re trying to take it away from you, maybe because of politics or maybe because of political views. We can’t let that happen.\\n\\nSo with that, let’s get on to business, right? It’s really something. Thank you.  \\n\\nI want to thank Sheriff Sandra Hutchens and Chief Tom Manger for your leadership and, frankly, for the service. You have had great service. Everyone has told me about you two legendary people. All of us here today are united by one shared mission: to serve and protect the public of the United States.\\n\\nDuring my campaign for President, I had the chance to spend time with law enforcement officials all across our country. They are the most incredible people you will ever meet. And I just wanted to say to all of them right now, from the bottom of my heart, thank you, thank you, thank you.  \\n\\nThere are many actions we in the federal government can take to help improve safety in your communities. But I believe that community safety begins with moral leadership. Our police officers, sheriffs and deputies risk their lives every day. And they’re entitled to an administration that has their back.  \\n\\nThe first step in restoring public safety is affirming our confidence in the men and women charged with upholding our laws. And I’m going to add justices, judges in that category. And I’m very proud to have picked Judge Gorsuch, who I think is going to be an outstanding member of the Supreme Court — outstanding.  \\n\\nSo I’d like to begin my remarks with a declaration issued to all of you, and delivered to every member of the law enforcement community all across the United States. My message today is that you have a true, true friend in the White House. You have.  I stand with you. I support our police. I support our sheriffs. And we support the men and women of law enforcement.  \\n\\nRight now, many communities in America are facing a public safety crisis. Murders in 2015 experienced their largest single-year increase in nearly half a century. In 2016, murders in large cities continued to climb by double digits. In many of our biggest cities, 2016 brought an increase in the number of homicides, rapes, assaults and shootings. In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone, and the rate so far this year has been even higher. What is going on in Chicago? \\n\\nWe cannot allow this to continue. We’ve allowed too many young lives to be claimed — and you see that, you see that all over — claimed by gangs, and too many neighborhoods to be crippled by violence and fear. Sixty percent of murder victims under the age of 22 are African American. This is a national tragedy, and it requires national action. This violence must end, and we must all work together to end it.\\n\\nWhether a child lives in Detroit, Chicago, Baltimore, or anywhere in our country, he or she has the right to grow up in safety and in peace. No one in America should be punished because of the city where he or she is born. Every child in America should be able to play outside without fear, walk home without danger, and attend a school without being worried about drugs or gangs or violence.\\n\\nSo many lives and so many people have been cut short. Their potential, their life has been cut short. So much potential has been sidelined. And so many dreams have been shattered and broken, totally broken. It’s time to stop the drugs from pouring into our country. And, by the way, we will do that. And I will say this: General, now Secretary, Kelly will be the man to do it, and we will give him a wall. And it will be a real wall.  And a lot of things will happen very positively for your cities, your states, believe me. The wall is getting designed right now. A lot of people say, oh, oh, Trump was only kidding with the wall. I wasn’t kidding. I don’t kid. I don’t kid. I watch this, and they say I was kidding. No, I don’t kid. I don’t kid about things like that, I can tell you. No, we will have a wall. It will be a great wall, and it will do a lot of — will be a big help. Just ask Israel about walls. Do walls work? Just ask Israel. They work — if it’s properly done. \\n\\nIt’s time to dismantle the gangs terrorizing our citizens, and it’s time to ensure that every young American can be raised in an environment of decency, dignity, love and support. You have asked for the resources, tools and support you need to get the job done. We will do whatever we can to help you meet those demands. That includes a zero tolerance policy for acts of violence against law enforcement.  We all see what happens. We all see what happens and what’s been happening to you. It’s not fair. \\n\\nWe must protect those who protect us. The number of officers shot and killed in the line of duty last year increased by 56 percent from the year before. Last year, in Dallas, police officers were targeted for execution –- think of this. Who ever heard of this? They were targeted for execution. Twelve were shot and five were killed. These heroic officers died as they lived -– protecting the innocent, rushing into danger, risking their lives for people they did not even know, but for people that they were determined to save. Hats off to you people.\\n\\nThese slain officers are an eternal monument to all of the men and women who protect our streets and serve our public. We will not forget them, and we will not forget all of the others who made that final sacrifice in the line of duty.\\n\\nGod has blessed our nation to put these heroes among us. Those who serve in law enforcement work long hours. You work long hours. I know so many sheriffs, so many chiefs, so many police who work long hours and dangerous hours, oftentimes in difficult conditions and for not that much pay relative to what you’re doing. They do it because they care. \\n\\nWe must work with them, not against them. They’re working against you. For many years they’ve been working against you. We must support them, not undermine them. And instead of division and disunity — and which is so much disunity — we must build bridges of partnership and of trust. Those who demonize law enforcement or who use the actions of a few to discredit the service of many are hurting the very people they say that they want to help. When policing is reduced, crime is increased, and our poorest citizens suffer the most. And I see it all the time. When the number of police goes down, crime goes up.\\n\\nTo build needed trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve, it is not enough for us to merely talk to each other. We must listen to each other. All of us share the view that those in uniform must be held to the highest possible standard of conduct — so important. \\n\\nYou\\'re the role models to young Americans all across this country, many of whom want to go into law enforcement, many of whom want to be a sheriff or a police chief, many of whom — they have great respect for you. Tremendous respect. You don\\'t even realize it, but I will tell you, they have great respect and admiration for the people in this room and the people that you represent. And don\\'t let anyone ever tell you different. Don\\'t let the dishonest media try and convince you that it\\'s different than that, because it\\'s not.   \\n\\nThat is why our commitment to law and law enforcement also includes ensuring that we are giving departments the resources they need to train, recruit and retain talent. As part of our commitment to safe communities, we will also work to address the mental health crisis. Prisons should not be a substitute for treatment. We will fight to increase access to life-saving treatment to battle the addiction to drugs, which is afflicting our nation like never ever before — ever.   \\n\\nI\\'ve been here two weeks. I\\'ve met a lot of law enforcement officials. Yesterday, I brought them into the Oval Office. I asked a group, what impact do drugs have in terms of a percentage on crime? They said, 75 to 80 percent. That\\'s pretty sad. We\\'re going to stop the drugs from pouring in. We\\'re going to stop those drugs from poisoning our youth, from poisoning our people. We\\'re going to be ruthless in that fight. We have no choice.\\n\\nAnd we\\'re going to take that fight to the drug cartels and work to liberate our communities from their terrible grip of violence. You have the power and knowledge to tell General Kelly — now Secretary Kelly — who the illegal immigrant gang members are. Now, you have that power because you know them, you\\'re there, you\\'re local. You know the illegals, you know them by their first name, you know them by their nicknames. You have that power. The federal government can never be that precise. But you\\'re in the neighborhoods — you know the bad ones, you know the good ones. \\n\\nI want you to turn in the bad ones. Call Secretary Kelly\\'s representatives and we\\'ll get them out of our country and bring them back where they came from, and we\\'ll do it fast. You have to call up the federal government, Homeland Security, because so much of the problems — you look at Chicago and you look at other places. So many of the problems are caused by gang members, many of whom are not even legally in our country.\\n\\nAnd we will work with you on the frontlines to keep America safe from terrorism, which is what I began this with. Terrorism — a tremendous threat, far greater than people in our country understand. Believe me. I\\'ve learned a lot in the last two weeks. And terrorism is a far greater threat than the people of our country understand. But we\\'re going to take care of it. We\\'re going to win. We\\'re going to take care of it, folks.\\n\\nLet today be the beginning of a great national partnership. Let today serve as a great call to action. And let this moment represent a new beginning in relations between law enforcement and our communities. I want you to know the American public totally stands with you. I want you to know the American people support you. I want you to know how proud we are, truly proud, to know you. \\n\\nWe applaud your efforts. We thank you for your service. And we promise that you will always find an open door at the White House — an open invitation to our great cops and sheriffs nationwide. They\\'re great people. You are great people.\\n\\nThank you. God bless you. And God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you.'), ('Trump Black History Month Speech.txt', 'Well, the election, it came out really well. Next time we’ll triple the number or quadruple it. We want to get it over 51, right? At least 51.\\n\\nWell this is Black History Month, so this is our little breakfast, our little get-together. Hi Lynn, how are you? Just a few notes. During this month, we honor the tremendous history of African-Americans throughout our country. Throughout the world, if you really think about it, right? And their story is one of unimaginable sacrifice, hard work, and faith in America. I’ve gotten a real glimpse—during the campaign, I’d go around with Ben to a lot of different places I wasn’t so familiar with. They’re incredible people. And I want to thank Ben Carson, who’s gonna be heading up HUD. That’s a big job. That’s a job that’s not only housing, but it’s mind and spirit. Right, Ben? And you understand, nobody’s gonna be better than Ben.\\n\\nLast month, we celebrated the life of Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., whose incredible example is unique in American history. You read all about Dr. Martin Luther King a week ago when somebody said I took the statue out of my office. It turned out that that was fake news. Fake news. The statue is cherished, it’s one of the favorite things in the—and we have some good ones. We have Lincoln, and we have Jefferson, and we have Dr. Martin Luther King. But they said the statue, the bust of Martin Luther King, was taken out of the office. And it was never even touched. So I think it was a disgrace, but that’s the way the press is. Very unfortunate.\\n\\nI am very proud now that we have a museum on the National Mall where people can learn about Reverend King, so many other things. Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody who’s done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I noticed. Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, and millions more black Americans who made America what it is today. Big impact.\\n\\nI’m proud to honor this heritage and will be honoring it more and more. The folks at the table in almost all cases have been great friends and supporters. Darrell—I met Darrell when he was defending me on television. And the people that were on the other side of the argument didn’t have a chance, right? And Paris has done an amazing job in a very hostile CNN community. He’s all by himself. You’ll have seven people, and Paris. And I’ll take Paris over the seven. But I don’t watch CNN, so I don’t get to see you as much as I used to. I don’t like watching fake news. But Fox has treated me very nice. Wherever Fox is, thank you.\\n\\nWe’re gonna need better schools and we need them soon. We need more jobs, we need better wages, a lot better wages. We’re gonna work very hard on the inner city. Ben is gonna be doing that, big league. That’s one of the big things that you’re gonna be looking at. We need safer communities and we’re going to do that with law enforcement. We’re gonna make it safe. We’re gonna make it much better than it is right now. Right now it’s terrible, and I saw you talking about it the other night, Paris, on something else that was really—you did a fantastic job the other night on a very unrelated show.\\n\\nI’m ready to do my part, and I will say this: We’re gonna work together. This is a great group, this is a group that’s been so special to me. You really helped me a lot. If you remember I wasn’t going to do well with the African-American community, and after they heard me speaking and talking about the inner city and lots of other things, we ended up getting—and I won’t go into details—but we ended up getting substantially more than other candidates who had run in the past years. And now we’re gonna take that to new levels. I want to thank my television star over here—Omarosa’s actually a very nice person, nobody knows that. I don’t want to destroy her reputation but she’s a very good person, and she’s been helpful right from the beginning of the campaign, and I appreciate it. I really do. Very special.\\n\\nSo I want to thank everybody for being here.'), ('Trump Inauguration Speech.txt', '\"Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans and people of the world, thank you.\\n\\nWe, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all of our people.\\n\\nTogether, we will determine the course of America and the world for many, many years to come.

Very, very special people.  And it is true, this is my first stop, officially.  We’re not talking about the balls, or we’re not talking about even the speeches -- although they did treat me nicely on that speech yesterday.    I always call them the dishonest media, but they treated me nicely.   \\n\\nBut I want to say that there is nobody that feels stronger about the intelligence community and the CIA than Donald Trump.  There’s nobody.   \\n\\nThe wall behind me is very, very special.  We’ve been touring for quite a while, and I’ll tell you what -- 29?  I can’t believe it.\\n\\nOh, 28.  We got to reduce it.  That’s amazing.  And we really appreciate what you’ve done in terms of showing us something very special.  And your whole group, these are really special, amazing people.  Very, very few people could do the job you people do.  And I want to just let you know, I am so behind you.  And I know maybe sometimes you haven’t gotten the backing that you’ve wanted, and you’re going to get so much backing.  Maybe you’re going to say, please don’t give us so much backing.    Mr. President, please, we don’t need that much backing.    But you’re going to have that.  And I think everybody in this room knows it.\\n\\nYou know, the military and the law enforcement, generally speaking, but all of it -- but the military gave us tremendous percentages of votes.  We were unbelievably successful in the election with getting the vote of the military.  And probably almost everybody in this room voted for me, but I will not ask you to raise your hands if you did.    But I would guarantee a big portion, because we’re all on the same wavelength, folks.    We’re all on the same wavelength, right?  He knows.  It took Brian about 30 seconds to figure that one out, right, because we know we’re on the same wavelength.\\n\\nBut we’re going to do great things.  We’re going to do great things.  We’ve been fighting these wars for longer than any wars we’ve ever fought.  We have not used the real abilities that we have.  We’ve been restrained.  We have to get rid of ISIS.  Have to get rid of ISIS.  We have no choice.    Radical Islamic terrorism.  And I said it yesterday -- it has to be eradicated just off the face of the Earth.  This is evil.  This is evil.  And you know, I can understand the other side.  We can all understand the other side.  There can be wars between countries, there can be wars.  You can understand what happened.  This is something nobody can even understand.  This is a level of evil that we haven’t seen.  And you’re going to go to it, and you’re going to do a phenomenal job.  But we’re going to end it.  It’s time.  It’s time right now to end it.\\n\\nYou have somebody coming on who is extraordinary.  For the different positions of “Secretary of This” and “Secretary of That” and all of these great positions, I’d see five, six, seven, eight people.  And we had a great transition.  We had an amazing team of talent.  And, by the way, General Flynn is right over here.  Put up your hand.  What a good guy.    And Reince and my whole group.  Reince -- you know -- they don’t care about Reince.  He’s like this political guy that turned out to be a superstar, right?  We don’t have to talk about Reince.\\n\\nBut we did -- we had such a tremendous, tremendous success.  So when I’m interviewing all of these candidates that Reince and his whole group is putting in front, it went very, very quickly, and, in this case, went so quickly -- because I would see six or seven or eight for Secretary of Agriculture, who we just named the other day, Sonny Perdue, former governor of Georgia.  Fantastic guy.  But I’d see six, seven, eight people for a certain position.  Everybody wanted it. \\n\\nBut I met Mike Pompeo, and it was the only guy I met.  I didn’t want to meet anybody else.  I said, cancel everybody else.  Cancel.  Now, he was approved, essentially, but they’re doing little political games with me.  He was one of the three.  Now, last night, as you know, General Mattis, fantastic guy, and General Kelly got approved.    And Mike Pompeo was supposed to be in that group.  It was going to be the three of them.  Can you imagine all of these guys?  People respect -- you know, they respect that military sense.  All my political people, they’re not doing so well.  The political people aren’t doing so well but you.  We’re going to get them all through, but some will take a little bit longer than others. \\n\\nBut Mike was literally -- I had a group of -- what, we had nine different people?  Now, I must say, I didn’t mind cancelling eight appointments.  That wasn’t the worst thing in the world.  But I met him and I said, he is so good.  Number one in his class at West Point. \\n\\nNow, I know a lot about West Point.  I’m a person that very strongly believes in academics.  In fact, every time I say I had an uncle who was a great professor at MIT for 35 years who did a fantastic job in so many different ways, academically -- was an academic genius -- and then they say, is Donald Trump an intellectual?  Trust me, I’m like a smart persona.    And I recognized immediately.  So he was number one at West Point, and he was also essentially number one at Harvard Law School.  And then he decided to go into the military.  And he ran for Congress.  And everything he’s done has been a homerun.  People like him, but much more importantly to me, everybody respects him.  And when I told Paul Ryan that I wanted to do this, I would say he may be the only person that was not totally thrilled -- right, Mike?  Because he said, I don’t want to lose this guy. \\n\\nBut you will be getting a total star.  You’re going to be getting a total gem.  He’s a gem.    You’ll see.  You’ll see.  And many of you know him anyway.  But you’re going to see.  And again, we have some great people going in.  But this one is something -- is going to be very special, because this is one, if I had to name the most important, this would certainly be perhaps -- you know, in certain ways, you could say my most important.  You do the job like everybody in this room is capable of doing.  And the generals are wonderful, and the fighting is wonderful.  But if you give them the right direction, boy, does the fighting become easier.  And, boy, do we lose so fewer lives, and win so quickly.  And that’s what we have to do.  We have to start winning again.\\n\\nYou know, when I was young and when I was -- of course, I feel young.  I feel like I’m 30, 35, 39.    Somebody said, are you young?  I said, I think I’m young.  You know, I was stopping -- when we were in the final month of that campaign, four stops, five stops, seven stops.  Speeches, speeches, in front of 25,000, 30,000 people, 15,000, 19,000 from stop to stop.  I feel young.\\n\\nWhen I was young -- and I think we’re all sort of young.  When I was young, we were always winning things in this country.  We’d win with trade.  We’d win with wars.  At a certain age, I remember hearing from one of my instructors, “The United States has never lost a war.”  And then, after that, it’s like we haven’t won anything.  We don’t win anymore.  The old expression, “to the victor belong the spoils” -- you remember.  I always used to say, keep the oil.  I wasn’t a fan of Iraq.  I didn’t want to go into Iraq.  But I will tell you, when we were in, we got out wrong.  And I always said, in addition to that, keep the oil.  Now, I said it for economic reasons.  But if you think about it, Mike, if we kept the oil you probably wouldn’t have ISIS because that’s where they made their money in the first place.  So we should have kept the oil.  But okay.    Maybe you’ll have another chance.  But the fact is, should have kept the oil. \\n\\nI believe that this group is going to be one of the most important groups in this country toward making us safe, toward making us winners again, toward ending all of the problems.  We have so many problems that are interrelated that we don’t even think of, but interrelated to the kind of havoc and fear that this sick group of people has caused.  So I can only say that I am with you 1,000 percent. \\n\\nAnd the reason you’re my first stop is that, as you know, I have a running war with the media.  They are among the most dishonest human beings on Earth.    And they sort of made it sound like I had a feud with the intelligence community.  And I just want to let you know, the reason you’re the number-one stop is exactly the opposite -- exactly.  And they understand that, too. \\n\\nAnd I was explaining about the numbers.  We did a thing yesterday at the speech.  Did everybody like the speech?    I’ve been given good reviews.  But we had a massive field of people.  You saw them.  Packed.  I get up this morning, I turn on one of the networks, and they show an empty field.  I say, wait a minute, I made a speech.  I looked out, the field was -- it looked like a million, million and a half people.  They showed a field where there were practically nobody standing there.  And they said, Donald Trump did not draw well.  I said, it was almost raining, the rain should have scared them away, but God looked down and he said, we’re not going to let it rain on your speech. \\n\\nIn fact, when I first started, I said, oh, no.  The first line, I got hit by a couple of drops.  And I said, oh, this is too bad, but we’ll go right through it.  But the truth is that it stopped immediately.  It was amazing.  And then it became really sunny.  And then I walked off and it poured right after I left.  It poured.  But, you know, we have something that’s amazing because we had -- it looked -- honestly, it looked like a million and a half people.  Whatever it was, it was.  But it went all the way back to the Washington Monument.  And I turn on -- and by mistake I get this network, and it showed an empty field.  And it said we drew 250,000 people.  Now, that’s not bad, but it’s a lie.  We had 250,000 people literally around -- you know, in the little bowl that we constructed.  That was 250,000 people.  The rest of the 20-block area, all the way back to the Washington Monument, was packed.  So we caught them, and we caught them in a beauty.  And I think they’re going to pay a big price. \\n\\nWe had another one yesterday, which was interesting.  In the Oval Office there’s a beautiful statue of Dr. Martin Luther King.  And I also happen to like Churchill, Winston Churchill.  I think most of us like Churchill.  He doesn’t come from our country, but had a lot to do with it.  Helped us; real ally.  And, as you know, the Churchill statue was taken out -- the bust.  And as you also probably have read, the Prime Minister is coming over to our country very shortly.  And they wanted to know whether or not I’d like it back.  I say, absolutely, but in the meantime we have a bust of Churchill. \\n\\nSo a reporter for Time magazine -- and I have been on there cover, like, 14 or 15 times.  I think we have the all-time record in the history of Time Magazine.  Like, if Tom Brady is on the cover, it’s one time, because he won the Super Bowl or something, right?    I’ve been on it for 15 times this year.  I don’t think that’s a record, Mike, that can ever be broken.  Do you agree with that?  What do you think? \\n\\nBut I will say that they said -- it was very interesting -- that Donald Trump took down the bust, the statue, of Dr. Martin Luther King.  And it was right there.  But there was a cameraman that was in front of it.    So Zeke -- Zeke from Time Magazine writes a story about I took down.  I would never do that because I have great respect for Dr. Martin Luther King.  But this is how dishonest the media is.\\n\\nNow, the big story -- the retraction was, like, where?  Was it a line?  Or do they even bother putting it in?  So I only like to say that because I love honesty.  I like honest reporting. \\n\\nI will tell you, final time -- although I will say it, when you let in your thousands of other people that have been trying to come in -- because I am coming back -- we’re going to have to get you a larger room.    We may have to get you a larger room.  You know?  And maybe, maybe, it will be built by somebody that knows how to build, and we won’t have columns.    You understand that?    We get rid of the columns.\\n\\nNo, I just wanted to really say that I love you, I respect you.  There’s nobody I respect more.  You’re going to do a fantastic job.  And we’re going to start winning again, and you’re going to be leading the charge. \\n\\nSo thank you all very much.    Thank you -- you’re beautiful.  Thank you all very much.  Have a good time.  I’ll be back.  I’ll be back.  Thank you.'), ('Trump Nomination Speech.txt', \"Friends, delegates and fellow Americans: I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.\\n\\n\\nTogether, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace. We will be a country of generosity and warmth. But we will also be a country of law and order.\\n\\nOur Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation. The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.\\n\\nAmericans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities. Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its victims.\\n\\nI have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end. Beginning on January 20th 2017, safety will be restored.\\n\\nThe most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens. Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead.\\n\\nIt is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation.\\n\\nI will present the facts plainly and honestly. We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.\\n\\nSo if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully-crafted lies, and the media myths the Democrats are holding their convention next week.\\n\\nBut here, at our convention, there will be no lies. We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else.\\n\\n\\n\\nDecades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administration’s rollback of criminal enforcement.\\n\\nHomicides last year increased by 17% in America’s fifty largest cities. That’s the largest increase in 25 years. In our nation’s capital, killings have risen by 50 percent. They are up nearly 60% in nearby Baltimore.\\n\\nIn the President’s hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 have been the victims of shootings this year alone. And more than 3,600 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office.\\n\\nThe number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50% compared to this point last year. Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens.\\n\\nThe number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015. They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources.\\n\\nOne such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska. There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root. She was 21 years-old, and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 Grade Point Average. Her killer was then released a second time, and he is now a fugitive from the law.\\n\\nI’ve met Sarah’s beautiful family. But to this Administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn’t worth protecting. One more child to sacrifice on the altar of open borders. What about our economy?\\n\\nAgain, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper: Nearly Four in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African American youth are not employed. 2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when the President took his oath of office less than eight years ago. Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely.\\n\\nHousehold incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000. Our manufacturing trade deficit has reached an all-time high – nearly $800 billion in a single year. The budget is no better.\\n\\nPresident Obama has doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing. Yet, what do we have to show for it? Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are in Third World condition, and forty-three million Americans are on food stamps.\\n\\nNow let us consider the state of affairs abroad.\\n\\nNot only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they have lived through one international humiliation after another. We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint.\\n\\nThis was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us nothing – it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever made. Another humiliation came when president Obama drew a red line in Syria – and the whole world knew it meant nothing.\\n\\nIn Libya, our consulate – the symbol of American prestige around the globe – was brought down in flames. America is far less safe – and the world is far less stable – than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America’s foreign policy.\\n\\nI am certain it is a decision he truly regrets. Her bad instincts and her bad judgment – something pointed out by Bernie Sanders – are what caused the disasters unfolding today. Let’s review the record. In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map.\\n\\nLibya was cooperating. Egypt was peaceful. Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Syria was under control. After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have? ISIS has spread across the region, and the world. Libya is in ruins, and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers. Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control. Iraq is in chaos.\\n\\nIran is on the path to nuclear weapons. Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis that now threatens the West. After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before.\\n\\nThis is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction and weakness.\\n\\nBut Hillary Clinton’s legacy does not have to be America’s legacy. The problems we face now – poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad – will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them. A change in leadership is required to change these outcomes. Tonight, I will share with you my plan of action for America.\\n\\nThe most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents, is that our plan will put America First. Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo. As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect. This will all change in 2017.\\n\\nThe American People will come first once again. My plan will begin with safety at home – which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and protection from terrorism. There can be no prosperity without law and order. On the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America.\\n\\nA number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation’s most powerful special interests. That is because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit.\\n\\nBig business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place. They are throwing money at her because they have total control over everything she does. She is their puppet, and they pull the strings.\\n\\nThat is why Hillary Clinton’s message is that things will never change. My message is that things have to change – and they have to change right now. Every day I wake up determined to deliver for the people I have met all across this nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned.\\n\\nI have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals. These are the forgotten men and women of our country. People who work hard but no longer have a voice.\\n\\nI AM YOUR VOICE.\\n\\nI have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good. I have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.\\n\\nWhen innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws – or worse still, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash – I am not able to look the other way.\\n\\nAnd when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can’t see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence – I know that corruption has reached a level like never before.\\n\\nWhen the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was “extremely careless” and “negligent,” in handling our classified secrets, I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did. They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible crimes.\\n\\nIn fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such an egregious crime and getting away with it – especially when others have paid so dearly. When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers I know the time for action has come.\\n\\nI have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves. Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it. I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders – he never had a chance.\\n\\nBut his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest issue: trade. Millions of Democrats will join our movement because we are going to fix the system so it works for all Americans. In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana.\\n\\nWe will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to Indiana. He is a man of character and accomplishment. He is the right man for the job. The first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities.\\n\\nAmerica was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were brutally executed. In the days after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials. Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee.\\n\\nOn Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Three were killed, and four were badly injured. An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans. I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: when I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order our country.\\n\\nI will work with, and appoint, the best prosecutors and law enforcement officials in the country to get the job done. In this race for the White House, I am the Law And Order candidate. The irresponsible rhetoric of our President, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment for everyone.\\n\\nThis Administration has failed America’s inner cities. It’s failed them on education. It’s failed them on jobs. It’s failed them on crime. It’s failed them at every level.\\n\\nWhen I am President, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally.\\n\\nEvery action I take, I will ask myself: does this make life better for young Americans in Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Ferguson who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child America?\\n\\nTo make life safe in America, we must also address the growing threats we face from outside America: we are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS. Once again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism.\\n\\nMen, women and children viciously mowed down. Lives ruined. Families ripped apart. A nation in mourning.\\n\\nThe damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been over and over – at the World Trade Center, at an office party in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, and a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\\n\\nOnly weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted our LGBT community. As your President, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBT citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology. To protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things.\\n\\nWe must have the best intelligence gathering operation in the world. We must abandon the failed policy of nation building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria. Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terror.\\n\\nThis includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the State of Israel. Lastly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place.\\n\\nMy opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under President Obama. She proposes this despite the fact that there’s no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from. I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people.\\n\\nAnyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never will be.\\n\\nDecades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers. We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the American people.\\n\\nOn Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and Jamiel Shaw. They are just three brave representatives of many thousands. Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more deeply than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our border.\\n\\nThese families have no special interests to represent them. There are no demonstrators to protest on their behalf. My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain. Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities. But where was sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, Sabine and Jamiel? Where was sanctuary for all the other Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so horribly?\\n\\nThese wounded American families have been alone. But they are alone no longer. Tonight, this candidate and this whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering the same awful fate.\\n\\nWe are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities. I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America’s Border Patrol Agents, and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful immigration system.\\n\\nBy ending catch-and-release on the border, we will stop the cycle of human smuggling and violence. Illegal border crossings will go down. Peace will be restored. By enforcing the rules for the millions who overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive the respect they deserve.\\n\\nTonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied – and every politician who has denied them – to listen very closely to the words I am about to say.\\n\\nOn January 21st of 2017, the day after I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced. We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone.\\n\\nBut my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens. My plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton. Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration. Communities want relief.\\n\\nYet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness. Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape from poverty.\\n\\nI have a different vision for our workers. It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat. It’s been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office.\\n\\nI have made billions of dollars in business making deals – now I’m going to make our country rich again. I am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great ones. America has lost nearly-one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton.\\n\\nRemember, it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA, one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country.\\n\\nNever again.\\n\\nI am going to bring our jobs back to Ohio and to America – and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequences.\\n\\nMy opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class. She supported NAFTA, and she supported China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization – another one of her husband’s colossal mistakes.\\n\\nShe supported the job killing trade deal with South Korea. She has supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The TPP will not only destroy our manufacturing, but it will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments. I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers, or that diminishes our freedom and independence. Instead, I will make individual deals with individual countries.\\n\\nNo longer will we enter into these massive deals, with many countries, that are thousands of pages long – and which no one from our country even reads or understands. We are going to enforce all trade violations, including through the use of taxes and tariffs, against any country that cheats.\\n\\nThis includes stopping China’s outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation. Our horrible trade agreements with China and many others, will be totally renegotiated. That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a much better deal for America – and we’ll walk away if we don’t get the deal that we want. We are going to start building and making things again.\\n\\nNext comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules. While Hillary Clinton plans a massive tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has declared for the presidential race this year – Democrat or Republican. Middle-income Americans will experience profound relief, and taxes will be simplified for everyone.\\n\\nAmerica is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world. Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country. Then we are going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest job-killers of them all. Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end it. We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy. This will produce more than $20 trillion in job creating economic activity over the next four decades.\\n\\nMy opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and steel workers of our country out of work – that will never happen when I am President. With these new economic policies, trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country.\\n\\nThis new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans – We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow. This, in turn, will create millions more jobs. We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice.\\n\\nMy opponent would rather protect education bureaucrats than serve American children. We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare. You will be able to choose your own doctor again. And we will fix TSA at the airports! We will completely rebuild our depleted military, and the countries that we protect, at a massive loss, will be asked to pay their fair share.\\n\\nWe will take care of our great Veterans like they have never been taken care of before. My opponent dismissed the VA scandal as being not widespread – one more sign of how out of touch she really is. We are going to ask every Department Head in government to provide a list of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days. The politicians have talked about it, I’m going to do it. We are also going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our Constitution.\\n\\nThe replacement for Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views and principles. This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election. My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment. I, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association and will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe.\\n\\nAt this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical community who have been so good to me and so supportive. You have so much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits.\\n\\nAn amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views.\\n\\nI am going to work very hard to repeal that language and protect free speech for all Americans. We can accomplish these great things, and so much else – all we need to do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again. It is time to show the whole world that America Is Back – bigger, and better and stronger than ever before.\\n\\nIn this journey, I'm so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my wonderful children, Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: you will always be my greatest source of pride and joy. My Dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew. I wonder sometimes what he’d say if he were here to see this tonight.\\n\\nIt’s because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people. He was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers, carpenters, and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also. Then there’s my mother, Mary. She was strong, but also warm and fair-minded. She was a truly great mother. She was also one of the most honest and charitable people I have ever known, and a great judge of character.\\n\\nTo my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will always give you my love you are most special to me. I have loved my life in business.\\n\\nBut now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country – to go to work for all of you. It’s time to deliver a victory for the American people. But to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past.\\n\\nAmerica is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics, and cynics.\\n\\nRemember: all of the people telling you that you can’t have the country you want, are the same people telling you that I wouldn’t be standing here tonight. No longer can we rely on those elites in media, and politics, who will say anything to keep a rigged system in place.\\n\\nInstead, we must choose to Believe In America. History is watching us now.\\n\\nIt’s waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong.\\n\\nMy opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge. It reads: “I’m With Her”. I choose to recite a different pledge.\\n\\nMy pledge reads: “I’M WITH YOU – THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.”\\n\\nI am your voice.\\n\\nSo to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I’m With You, and I will fight for you, and I will win for you.\\n\\nTo all Americans tonight, in all our cities and towns, I make this promise: We Will Make America Strong Again.\\n\\nWe Will Make America Proud Again.\\n\\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\\n\\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\\n\\nTHANK YOU.\"), ('Trump Florida Rally 2-18-17.txt', \"Thank you, everybody, thank you. I didn't know that Melania was going to be saying the Lord's Prayer, but I thought that was very beautiful, thank you, thank you.\\n\\nIt's so great to be here in Florida. My second home with you. This is a state I truly love. This is a state where we all had great victory together. Thank you.\\n\\nIt's now been a month since my inauguration. And I am here to tell you about our incredible progress in making America great again. I'm also here to tell you about our plans for the future and they're big and they're bold and It's what our country is all about, believe me.\\n\\nI'm here because I want to be among my friends and among the people. This was a great movement, a movement like has never been seen before in our country our probably anywhere else. This was a truly great movement And I want to be here with you, and I will always be with you. I promise you that. I want to be in a room filled with hard working American patriots who love their country, who salute their flag and who pray for a better future.\\n\\nI also want to speak to you without the filter of the fake news. The dishonest media which has published one false story after another with no sources, even though they pretend they have them, they make them up in many cases, they just don't want to report the truth and they've been calling us wrong now for two years. They don't get it. By they're starting to get it. I can tell you that. They've become a big part of the problem. They are part of the corrupt system. Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, and Abraham Lincoln and many of our greatest presidents fought with the media and called them out often times on their lies. When the media lies to people, I will never, ever let them get away with it. I will do whatever I can that. They don't get away with it.\\n\\nThey have their own agenda and their agenda is not your agenda. In fact, Thomas Jefferson said, “nothing can be believed which is seen in a newspaper.” “Truth itself,” he said, “becomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle,” that was June 14, my birthday, 1807. But despite all their lies, misrepresentations, and false stories, they could not defeat us in the primaries, and they could not defeat us in the general election, and we will continue to expose them for what they are, and most importantly, we will continue to win, win, win.\\n\\nWe are not going to let the fake news tell us what to do, how to live, or what to believe. We are free and independent people and we will make our own choices.\\n\\nWe are here today to speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I hear your demands, I hear your voices and I promise you I will deliver. I promise that. And by the way, you've seen what we've accomplished in a very short period of time. The White House is running so smoothly. So smoothly. And believe me, I and we inherited one big mess. That I can tell you, but I know that you want safe neighborhoods where the streets belong to families and communities, not gang members and drug dealers who are right now as I speak being thrown out of the country and they will not be let back in.\\n\\nWe will have strong borders again, and I mean that. You've seen it in television. You've seen it on television. General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, he's really doing the job. You're seeing it. The gang members, bad, bad people. I said day one, and they're going out. Or they're being put in prison, but for the most part, get them the hell out of here. Bring them back to where they came from.\\n\\nThe fact is, you want great schools for your children. You want good high paying jobs for yourselves and for your loved ones and for the future of your families. You want a health care system and by the way, we are going to be submitting in a couple of weeks a great healthcare plan that's going to take the place of the disaster known as Obamacare.\\n\\nIt will be repealed and replaced. For those people. The people put into rooms where Republicans are talking about the plan, and it wouldn't matter what they say, for those people just so you understand, our plan will be much better health care at a much lower coast. Okay? Nothing to complain about. Obamacare remember, it is a disaster.\\n\\nYou want low cost American energy also, which means lifting the restrictions on oil, on shell, on natural gas and on clean, very clean coal. We're going to put the miners back to work. The miners go back to work.\\n\\nYou want us to enforce immigration laws and defend our borders.\\n\\nYou want fair trade deals and a level playing field. We don't have a level playing field. Because you understand that when American workers win, America as a country wins and wins big. And every country over the last long period of time has been taking advantage of the [inaudible] of our politicians. It's not going to happen any longer.\\n\\nYou want lower taxes. Less regulation. Millions of new jobs and more product stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words, “Made in the USA.” You want to make it easy for companies to do business in America. And harder for companies to leave. We don't want companies saying, everybody is fired. We're moving to another country. We're going to make the product. Sell it across the border and isn't that wonderful. Not going happen anymore.\\n\\nWe're going to have strong borders and when they want to sell that product back across our border, they're going to pay a 35% tax and you know what, they're never going to leave. They will never, ever leave.\\n\\nAnd you've seen that because I've already displayed it for the last two months even before I got into office. They're not leaving. And if they do, they're going to pay a big price for terminating the relationship with our workers. You want a government that serves the people not the donors and special interest. You want a government that keeps its promises.\\n\\nA great spirit of optimism is sweeping and you see it. it's sweeping all across the country. Look at what's happening to the stock market. Look at what's happening to the every poll when it comes to optimism in our country. It's sweeping across the country. And, in fact, every day for the last long period of days this stock market means, companies, have been hitting new highs. They're going to start highs. It's going to be a new day in America. You're going to be proud again.\\n\\nJobs are already starting to pour back in. They're coming back in like you haven't seen in a long time. Ford, General Motors, Fiat, Chrysler are bringing in and bringing back thousands of jobs investing billions of dollars because of the new business climate that we are creating in our country. In Arizona, Intel, great company, just announced it will open a new plant that will create at least 10,000 brand new beautiful American jobs.\\n\\nI followed through on my promise to withdraw from the job killing disaster known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. TPP, we have just terminated our relationship to it. We're going to have tremendous trade deals all over the world, but they're going to be bilateral or as we would say, one-on-one. None of these deals where we get caught in quicksand. Get mired in and we can't do anything about it. By the way, NAFTA and so many others.\\n\\nMy administration has begun plans to crack down on foreign cheating and currency manipulation which is killing our companies and really, really hurting our workers. We're going to end it.\\n\\nWithin a few days of taking the oath of office, I've taken steps to begin the construction of the Keystone and the Dakota Access Pipelines. Anywhere from 30-40,000 jobs. And very importantly, as I was about to sign it, I said who makes the pipe? Who makes the pipe? Something this audience understands very well, right? Simple question. The lawyers put this very complex document in front. I said, who makes the pipe? They said, sir, it can be made anywhere. I said not anymore. I put a little clause in the bottom. The pipe has to be made in the United States of America if we're going to have pine line.\\n\\nWe believe in two simple rules. I can tell you everybody in this massive, this is a massive hanger. For the big planes. And by the way, do you think that one media group back there, one network will show this crowd. Not one. Not one. They won't show the crowd. You know, coming in on the plane, and that plane represented so much.\\n\\nAnd just so you know, they were close to signing a $4.2 billion deal to have a new Air Force One. Can you believe this? I said no way. I said I refuse to fly in a $4.2 billion airplane. I refuse. So I got Boeing and it is actually — a lot of people don't know. The Air Force One project is actually two planes. Why they need to planes, we'll have to talk about that, but they have two planes, but we've got that price down over a billion dollars and I probably have it spoken to be honest with you for honest probably an more than an hour on the project. I got the generals in who are fantastic. I got Boeing in. I told Boeing it's not good enough. We're still not going to do it. The price is still too high. On the fighter jet. We were hundreds of billions of dollars over budget. Seven years late, great plane. A great plane.\\n\\nSo think of it. They're seven years late. Hundreds of billions of dollars over-budget. Other than that by the way the project is going extremely well. And I got the folks in from Lockheed Martin who are terrific people and a terrific product by the way. I also got Boeing in. I said do me a favor, give me a competing offer. And now they're competing and fighting and we've gotten hundreds of millions of dollars off the price of a plane that was going to be ordered, in other words, if my opponent got in, there would have been no calls made to them. They would have signed contracts. So they're going to make plenty of money, but it's going to be a lot less than they would have made without Trump. That I can tell you. You might as well know about it. Nobody talks. By the way, that's for fighter jets. One of the biggest orders in the history of aviation. The order for the F-35. You've been reading about it because it was a disaster. Under the last administration. A disaster. And now we have it running beautifully.\\n\\nIn fact, when the Prime Minister of Japan, Prime Minister Abe, was great. Great guy. When he came over, he said, thank you. I said for what. You saved us many, many millions of dollars on the F-35 fighter jet. Because when I negotiated, I took our allies into the same negotiation. So the first thing he did was thanked med for saving them money and that's good. Okay. That's good. I know the media will never thank me so at least Japan is thanking me, right?\\n\\nBut we believe in two simple rules. Buy American and hire American. We believe it. We've just issued a new order which requires that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. And by the way, a new director was just approved. Can you imagine the length of time it's taken to Democrats and I actually think it's an embarrassment to them, but this is getting in to be record setting time. Incredible people.\\n\\nScott Pruitt was just approved, just now approved for the Environmental Protection Agency. He'll do so good. He won't have projects going ten and 12 years and getting rejected. They may be rejected, but they'll be rejected quickly. For the most part, they're going to be accepted. They're going to be environmentally friendly and he is going to be a great Secretary. He will be amazing. We're very happy. That took place yesterday. That's going to be a big difference because they were clogging up the veins of our country with the environmental impact statements and all of the rules and regulations. It was impossible to navigate for companies.\\n\\nAnd what did it really mean? Forget about the companies? What did it mean. It meant no jobs. It meant companies leaving our country and going to foreign countries to do things they would rather do here. So we're going to have a whole big situation. We are going to unfreeze all of those companies. They are going to be — they're going have freedom. Be able to build what they want to build. It will be environmentally friendly and we're going to start producing jobs like you've never seen before. That's going to happen. That was a big thing.\\n\\nWe're standing up for the incredible men and women always of law enforcement. We're standing up. And I can tell you, the military and law enforcement they stood up. I don't say for me. I'm the messenger folks. I'm the messenger. They stood up for us in this last election. We got numbers that nobody believed were possible from law enforcement and from military. Basically people they wear uniforms like us. Isn't that nice. I saw this man on TV just now, you. I just saw him on television. He said I love Trump. Let Trump do what he has to do. That's my guy right there. Come here. Come here. No, I just. I'm coming in. That's okay.\\n\\nLet him up. I'm not worried about him. I'm only worried he's going to give me a kiss. I'm not worried about anything else. This guy is so great. He was one of many people. They're interviewing people in the line. And I have to say, there was a tiny group of protesters out there and they were given as much publicity as this massive room packed with people, but they interviewed this man. Come on up here. Come on up. Guy was great. Hop over the fence. Come on. He can do it. He's in good shape. Look at him. Look at this guy. Come on. This guy is great. Don't worry about him. No, no. Come here. They're going to — come on up. Come here.\\n\\nThis guy. So he's been all over television saying the best things and I see him standing and didn't you get here at like 4 in the morning.\\n\\n\\nSay a couple of words to this crowd.\\n\\n\\nA star is born.\\n\\n\\nI wouldn't say that Secret Service was thrilled with that, but we know our people, right? We know our people. Great guy. And so many others. I see some others. Being interviewed. I see them over here. They started. They came at 4 in the morning. The media will give them no credit. The media, as I told you, won't show this crowd.\\n\\nAll the way outside of this — this is a big a hanger as you get. All the way outside. Way back to the fences. Amazing. I want to thank you, but I want to thank everybody.\\n\\nI've directed the Department of Justice to take a firm, firm stance to protect our cops, sheriffs, and police from crimes of violence against them. We will work with our police not against our police, our police do a great job and they've never been troubled like they're troubled now. It's very unfair what's happening. So we want to cherish our law enforcement. We will always protect those who protect us.\\n\\nWe've directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including our inner cities. We're going to make our inner cities safe again. Look at what's going on. Look at what's happening in Chicago. Hundreds of shootings, hundreds of deaths. I'll tell you what's happening in Chicago and many other places. Safety is a civil right. And we will fight to make America totally safe again.\\n\\nI've ordered the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy transnational criminal cartels which are all over the United States and we are going to stop the drugs from pours into your country, into your community, into your cities and poisoning our youth. We're stopping it. We're stopping it. We've taken historic action to secure the southern border and I've ordered the construction of a great border wall, which will start very shortly.\\n\\nAnd I've taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorist the hell out of our country. So you probably read where we want to enforce the laws as existing. And so we signed an order a couple of weeks ago, and it was taken over by a court originally by a judge and then a — yes, it's very sad. The reason is for protection and safety. So the statute is so plain and so clear.\\n\\nI said last week, I was speaking to a great group of sheriffs, the sheriffs group in Washington, and I said if you have a college education, you can understand its. If you have a high school education, you can understand it. If you were a bad student in high school, you can understand it.\\n\\nI was told. I'll check, but I found it hard to believe, over 30-page decision by the appellate court. Three judges. And you could tell by the way they were reacting because it was broadcast on television. Everything we do gets a lot of people watching. So you could tell by the way that phone call went, wasn't looking good. When they wrote their decision, as I understand it. Maybe I'm wrong.\\n\\nThey didn't write the statute they were making the decision about because every word of the statute is a total kill for the other side. So I thought I would read it. And here's what it says. This is what it says: “Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens into the United States” — okay. So essentially. Whenever somebody comes into the United States. Right.\\n\\n“If it would be detrimental to the interest of the United States” — okay. Now you know the country's we're talking about and these were countries picked by Obama. They weren't even picked. They were picked by Obama.\\n\\n“He may,” so the President may, “by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary” — now, because it should have said he or she, right. They were not politically correct when they drew this. In fact, that's the only thing that was actually wrong with it. He or she. I don't think the women care too much about that. Right? I don't think so. By the way, we did very well with women. You know, my wife said when some of these phony polls were put out, the CNN poll was so far off, the phony polls. When some of these, she said, what's wrong with you and women. We did very nicely with women. We did nicely with a lot of groups they didn't think we were going to do so nicely with. I guess we had to. That's why we're all here tonight. Right?\\n\\nSo and it goes, “for such as he shall seem necessary suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants or impose on aliens any restriction he may deem to be appropriate.” So basically it says the president has the right to keep people out if he feels it's not in the best interest of our country. Right? Unbelievable. Unbelievable. And I listened to these judges talk and talk and talk. So unfair. So we'll be doing something over the next couple of days. We don't give up. We never give up.\\n\\nWe had a court that I disagree with. I disagree with big league — and by the way, whether you read it or whether you watch it on television when other lawyers come on, many of them can't even understand. They're saying how do you come up with that decision. It cannot be more simple. So they're ruling on what I just read you and they don't even quote it in their ruling because you can't because it's too obvious. So we will do something next week. I think you'll be impressed. Let's see what happens.\\n\\nHere's the bottom line. We've got to keep our country safe. You look at what's happening. We've got to keep our country safe. You look at what's happening in Germany, you look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbers. They're having problems like they never thought possible. You look at what's happening in Brussels. You look at what's happening all over the world. Take a look at Nice. Take a look at Paris. We've allowed thousands and thousands of people into our country and there was no way to vet those people. There was no documentation. There was no nothing. So we're going to keep our country safe.\\n\\nAnd we all have heart, by the way. And what I want to do is build safe zones in Syria and other places so they can stay there and live safely until their cities and their country, that mess that I was left by Obama and everybody else — folks, we were left a mess like you wouldn't believe, but we're going to build safe zones. We're going to have those safe zones.\\n\\nWe do owe $20 trillion. Okay. So we're going to have the gulf states pay for those safe zones. They've got nothing, but money. We're going to do it that way instead of taking massive numbers. Tens the of thousands of people into our country and we don't know anything about those people. We want people to come into our country, but we want people that love us. We want people that can cherish us and the traditions of our country. We want people that are going to be great for our country. We don't want people with bad, bad ideas. We don't want that.\\n\\nI've also directed the defense community headed by General, now — you know, he said it, he said it — and now Secretary ‘Mad Dog’ Mattis, to develop a plan to totally destroy ISIS. I have ordered the department of defense to begin plans for the great rebuilding of the united states military. We will pursue peace through strength. Our military is badly depleted. You have planes in the military. Where the father flew them and now the son is flying them. Their so old. We make the best equipment anywhere in the world. We're going to start using our best and most modern equipment.\\n\\nAnd we're going to make sure our veterans have the care they need when they come home. We love our veterans. We're going to do a great job for our veterans. Our veterans have been very, very sadly treated. These are our great great people. We owe them so much. Our veterans are going to be taken care of for once and for all. Our system and our country has led down our veterans. We are not going to let that go on any further. You wait and you see what we're going to be doing for our great veterans. Thank you veterans. Who is here? Who is a veteran? We're going to take care of our veterans.\\n\\nWe're going to downsize the bloated, bloated bureaucracy which make the government lien and accountable. We're going to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. I've already imposed a five year lobbying ban on the executive branch officials and lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government.\\n\\nAnd there's another major promise I have kept to the American people. I've nominated a fantastic justice to replace the late great Justice Scalia. His name is Judge Neil Gorsuch. He comes from my list of 20 very, very highly qualified judges. He's incredible and has an incredible resume. He's respected by all. His education is as good as it can get. His writings are truly amazing. He will be a true, true defender of our constitution. So let's tell the Senate Democrats to support his nomination for the good of the country because what's happening with the Democrats — no wonder they're doing so badly.\\n\\nNo wonder they're doing so badly. You take a look, race after race, I just want the tell you, in case you didn't read it, of course you're reading the fake news, but the Democrats were supposed to win the presidency. That didn't happen. They were supposed to take over the Senate. That didn't happen. And they were supposed to take over potentially even the House. It was going to be four weeks out the greatest defeat in the modern history of American politics. And it was, but it was for the Democrats, not for the Republicans. So we have to tell the Democrats, because they're doing the wrong thing for the American people, to stop their tactics of delay and obstruction and destruction. They got to get on with it.\\n\\nMy administration is also pushing ahead strongly with very historic tax reform. We are working to lower tax rates in the middle class to reduce tax rates big league on businesses and to make our tax code more fair and very simple for all Americans so it's understandable by everyone. Senate Democrats should work with us to lower taxes and bring back our jobs, but the Democrats want to increase your taxes very, very substantially. We're not going let that happen.\\n\\nAlso time for the Senate Democrats to take responsibility for Obamacare and to work with us to replace it with new reforms that reverse this nation-wide healthcare tragedy. It's a tragedy. You look at some states, Arizona, up 116%. Your deductibles have gone so high you can never use it. Obamacare doesn't work. It's become totally unaffordable. Remember they said the healthcare, it's unaffordable. It doesn't work. And I said to the Republicans, I said you want to do something great politically: don't do anything. Sit back for two years, let it explode. The Democrats will come and beg for us to do something, but we can't do that to the American people. We have to fix it. And we will.\\n\\nWe need members of both parties to join hands and work with us to pass a $1 trillion infrastructure plan to build new roads and bridges and airports and tunnels and highways and railways all across our great nation.\\n\\nYou're all part of this incredible movement. This movement that we talk about so much. That's been written about on the cover of every magazine all over the world. It's a movement that is just sweeping. It's sweeping across our country. It's sweeping frankly across the globe. Look at Brexit. Look at Brexit. Much smaller example, but it's still something you can look at. People want to take back control of their countries and they want to take back control of their lives and the lives of their family.\\n\\nThe nation state remains the best model for human happiness and the American nation remains the greatest symbol of liberty, of freedom and justice on the face of god's earth. And now we have spirit like we've never had before. It's now that we have our sacred duty and we have no choice and we want this choice to defend our country, to protect its values and to serve its great, great citizens. Erasing national borders does not make people safer. It undermines democracy and trade prosperity. We're giving it away.\\n\\nThe so-called global elite have done well for themselves, but left working families with shrinking wages. Really they are shrinking. 18 years ago though many of you in this room made more money working one job than you're making right now working two and three jobs. Instead of peace, we've seen wars that never end and conflicts that never seem to go away. We don't fight to win. We fight politically correct wars. We don't win anymore. We don't win at trade. We don't win in any capacity. We don't win anymore. We're going to start winning again. Believe me.\\n\\nAnd we have the chance now working together to deliver change for the ages. This will be change for the ages. Change like never before. To pursue real peace, real stability, and real prosperity. We want to secure our borders and protect our workers. To rebuild our military and our infrastructure. To fix our schools and restore safety to our neighborhoods. To bring hope and opportunity to our inner cities. To ensure a level playing field for all women in the workforce. To reform our tax code and remove the regulations that undermine growth and innovation. And to replace chaos and distrust with community and cooperation. The tired echoes of yesterday's fights. We're fighting battles that no longer help us. We're fighting battles that other people aren't treating us fairly in the fight.\\n\\nI'm a NATO fan, but many of the countries in NATO, many of the countries that we protect, many of these countries are very rich countries. They're not paying their bills. They're not paying their bills. They have to help us. No longer are we chained down by the discredited approaches of the past. No longer must we listen to those who have nothing to brag about, but failure. New circumstances demand new solutions. Americans have fought and won wars together. Our heroes have shed their blood together and lost their lives. Our citizens have raised their children together, fought for justice together, and shared common hopes and dreams from one generation to the next. Stretching back to the first day of our American independence. This is our legacy. It belongs to all of you. And it belongs to every man, woman, and child in our nation.\\n\\nNow is the time to call upon these deep ties in the name of bold acts. Let us move past the differences party and find a new loyalty rooted deeply in our country. We are all brothers and all sisters. We share one home. One destiny and one glorious American flag. We are united together by history and by providence. We will make America strong again. I promise. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Greater than ever before.\\n\\nMay God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.\"), ('Trump Response to Healthcare Bill Failure.txt', \" Thank you very much. We were very close, and it was a very, very tight margin. We had no Democrat support. We had no votes from the Democrats. They weren't going to give us a single vote, so it's a very difficult thing to do.\\nI've been saying for the last year and a half that the best thing we can do politically speaking is let Obamacare explode. It is exploding right now. It's -- many states have big problems, almost all states have big problems. I was in Tennessee the other day and they've lost half of their state in terms of an insurer. They have no insurer. And that's happening to many other places. I was in Kentucky the other day and similar things are happening.\\nSo, Obamacare is exploding. With no Democrat support we couldn't quite get there. We were just a very small number of votes short in terms of getting our bill passed. A lot of people don't realize how good our bill was because they were viewing phase one. But when you add phase two, which was mostly the signings of Secretary Price, who is behind me, and you add phase three, which I think we would have gotten, it became a great bill. Premiums would have gone down and it would have been very stable. It would have been very strong. But that's okay. But we're very, very close and, again, I think what will happen is Obamacare, unfortunately, will explode. It's going to have a very bad year. Last year you had over 100 percent increases in various places.\\nIn Arizona I understand it's going up very rapidly again, like it did last year. Last year was 116 percent. Many places 50, 60, 70 percent. I guess it averaged whatever the average was, very, very high. And this year should be much worse for Obamacare.\\nSo, what would be really good with no Democrat support, if the Democrats when it explodes, which it will soon, if they got together with us and got a real health care bill, I'd be totally open to it, and I think that's going to happen. I think the losers are Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, because now they own Obamacare. They own it, 100 percent own it. And this is not a Republican health care. This is not anything but a Democrat health care.\\nAnd they have Obamacare for a little while longer, until it ceases to exist, which it will at some point in the near future. And just remember this is not our bill, this is their bill.\\nNow, when they all become civilized and get together and try and workout a great health care bill for the people of this country, we're open to it, we're totally open to it. I want to thank the Republican Party.\\nI want to thank Paul Ryan. He worked very, very hard, I will tell you that. He worked very, very hard.\\nTom Price and Mike Pence, who is right here, our vice president, our great vice president. Everybody worked hard. I worked as a team player, and would have loved to have seen it pass. But, again, I think you know I was very clear because I think there wasn't a speech I made, or very few where I didn't mention that perhaps the best thing that could happen is exactly what happened today, because we'll end up with a truly great health care bill in the future after this mess known as Obamacare explodes.\\nSo, I want to thank everybody for being here. It will go very smoothly. I really believe. I think this is something -- it certainly was an interesting period of time. We all learned a lot. We learned a lot about royalty. We learned a lot about the vote- getting process. We learned a lot about some very arcane rules in obviously both the Senate and in the House.\\nSo, it's been certainly, for me, it's been a very interesting experience. But in the end I think it's going to be an experience that leads to an even better health care plan. So, thank you all very much and I'll see you soon. Thank you.\\n\\n We'll probably be going right now for tax reform, which we could have done earlier, but this really would have worked out better if we could have had some Democrat support. Remember, this, we had no Democrat support. So, now we're going to go for tax reform which I've always liked.\\nQUESTION: And you're confident in Speaker Ryan's leadership and his ability to get things done?\\n Yes, am. I like Speaker Ryan. he worked very, very hard. A lot of different groups, he's got a lot of factions, and there's been a long history of liking and disliking, even within the Republican Party, long before I got here.\\nBut I've had a great relationship with the Republican Party. It seems that both sides like Trump, and that's good, and you see that, I guess, more clearly than anybody. But we've had -- I'm not going to speak badly about anybody within the party, but certainly there is a big history.\\nI think Paul really worked hard, and I would say that we will probably start going very, very strongly for the big tax cuts and tax reform. That will be next.\\n\\n Well, it's going to happen. There's not much you can do about it. It's going to -- bad things are going to happen to Obamacare. There's not much you can do to help it. I've been saying that for a year and a half. I said, look, eventually it's not sustainable. The insurance companies are leaving. You know that. They're leaving one by one as quick as you can leave. And you have states in some cases soon will not be covered. So, there's no way out of that.\\nBut the one thing that was happening as we got closer and closer, everybody was talking about how wonderful it was, and now it will go back to real life. People will see how bad it is, and it's getting much worse.\\nYou know, I said the other day when president Obama left, '17, he knew he wasn't going to be here. '17 is going to be a very, very bad year for Obamacare, very, very bad. You're going to have explosive premium increases, and your deductibles are so high people don't even get to use it.\\nSo they'll go with that for a little while. And I honestly believe -- I know some Democrats, and they're good people. I honestly believe the Democrats will come to us and say, look, let's get together and get a great health care bill or plan that's really great for the people of our country. And I think that's going to happen.\\n Well, we were very close. We were just probably anywhere from 10 to 15 votes short. Could have even been closer than that. You'll never know because you never know how though vote. But in the end I think we would have been 10 votes, maybe closer.\\nAnd -- but it's very hard to get almost 100 percent. You know, you're talking about a very, very large number of votes, among any group. And we were very close to doing it. But when you get no votes from the other side, meaning the Democrats, it's really a difficult situation.\\n No, I think we have to let Obamacare go its way for a little while. And we'll see how things go. I would love to see it do well, but it can't. I mean, it can't. I mean, it's not a question of, gee, I hope it does well, I would love it to do well. I want great health care for the people of this nation. But it can't do well.\\nIt's imploding and soon will explode and it's not going to be pretty. So, the Democrats don't want to see that. So, they're going to reach out when they're ready. And whenever they're ready, we're ready.\\n\\n No, not particularly. They're friends of mine. I'm disappointed because we could have had it. So I'm disappointed. I'm a little surprised, to be honest with you. We really had it. It was pretty much there within grasp.\\nBut I'll tell you what's going to come out of it is a better bill. I really believe a better bill, because there were things in this bill I didn't particularly like. And I think it's a better bill. You know, both parties can get together and do real health care, that's the best thing. Obamacare was rammed down everyone's throat, 100 percent Democrat. And I think having bipartisan would be a big, big improvement. So, no, I think that this is going to end up being a very good thing.\\nI'm disappointed, but they're friends of mine. And, you know, they got on -- it was a very hard time for them and a very hard vote. But they're very good people.\\n\\n Well, I think we could have had things that I would have liked more. And if we had bipartisan I really think we could have a health care bill that would be the ultimate. And I think the Democrats know that also.\\nAnd some day in the not too distant future that will happen. And I never said -- I guess I'm here, what, 64 days? I never said repeal and replace Obamacare. You've all heard my speeches. I never said repeal it and replace it within 64 days. I have a long time.\\nBut I want to have a great health care bill and plan, and we will. It will happen. And it won't be in the very distant future. I really believe there will be some Democrat support and that will happen, and it will be an even better bill.\\nI think this was a very good bill. I think it will be even better the next time around. And I don't think that's going to be in too long a period of time.\\n\\n No, I mean, I don't want to speak about specifics, but there are things I could have -- I would have liked even more. But I thought overall this was a very, very good bill.\\nAnd I thought Tom Price -- Dr. Tom Price, who really is amazing on health care and his knowledge, I thought he did a fantastic job. Same with Mike Pence. I think these two guys, they worked so hard and really did a fantastic job.\\nThank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\"), ('Trump CPAC Speech.txt', ' Thank you, everybody. So great to be with you. Thank you. \\nGreat to be back at CPAC.

I wouldn\\'t miss a chance to talk to my friends. These are my friends.\\n\\nAnd we\\'ll see you again next year and the year after that and I\\'ll be doing this...\\n\\n... I\\'ll be doing this with CPAC whenever I can and I\\'ll make sure that we\\'re here a lot.\\n\\n You know if you remember my first major speech -- sit down everybody. C\\'mon.\\n\\nYou know the dishonest media they\\'ll say, \"He didn\\'t get a standing ovation.\" You know why?\\n\\nNo -- you know why? Because everybody stood and nobody sat. So they will say, \"He never got a standing ovation,\" right? \\nThey are the worst.\\n\\n\\n So -- sit down.\\n\\n\"Donald Trump did not get a standing ovation.\"\\n\\nThey leave out the part, \"They never sat down.\" They leave that out.\\nSo I just want to thank -- but you know my first major speak was at CPAC and -- probably five or six years ago. First major political speech. And you were there. And it was -- I loved it. I loved the people. I loved the commotion.\\nAnd then they did these polls were I went through the roof and I wasn\\'t even running, right?\\n\\nBut it gave me an idea. And I got a little bit concerned when I saw what was happening in the country. And I said, \"Let\\'s go to it.\"\\nSo, it was very exciting. I walked the stage on CPAC. I\\'ll never forget it, really. I had very little notes and even less preparation. So when you have practically no notes and no preparation and then you leave and everybody was thrilled, I said, \"I think I like this business.\"\\nRead More: President Trump Just Boasted About Winning Polls at CPAC. He Lost 6 Times\\n\\nI would\\'ve come last year but I was worried that I would be, at that time, too controversial. We wanted border security. We wanted very, very strong military. We wanted all of the things that we\\'re going to get...\\n\\n... and people consider that controversial but you didn\\'t consider it controversial.\\n\\n So, I\\'ve been with CPAC for a long time. All of these years we\\'ve been together. And now you finally have a president, finally. Took you a long time.\\n\\nTook you a long time.\\n\\nAnd it\\'s patriots like you that made it happen, believe me. Believe me.\\nYou did it because you love your country, because you want a better future for your children and because you want to make America great again.\\n\\nThe media didn\\'t think we would win. The...\\n ... pundits -- you\\'re right. They had an idea.\\nThe pundits didn\\'t think we\\'d win. The consultants that suck up all that money -- oh, they suck it up. They\\'re so good.\\n\\nThey\\'re not good at politics, but they\\'re really good at sucking up people\\'s money. Especially my opponents, because I kept them down to a minimum.\\nBut the consultants didn\\'t think we would win.\\nBut they all underestimated the power of the people: You. And the people proved them...\\n\\n... totally wrong. Never -- and -- and this is so true. And this is what\\'s been happening. Never underestimate the people. Never.\\n\\nI don\\'t think it\\'ll ever happen again.\\nAnd I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news. It\\'s fake, phony, fake.\\n\\nA few days ago I called the fake news the enemy of the people. And they are. They are the enemy of the people.\\n\\nBecause they have no sources, they just make \\'em up when there are none. I saw one story recently where they said, \"Nine people have confirmed.\" There\\'re no nine people. I don\\'t believe there was one or two people. Nine people.\\nAnd I said, \"Give me a break.\" Because I know the people, I know who they talk to. There were no nine people.\\nBut they say \"nine people.\" And somebody reads it and they think, \"Oh, nine people. They have nine sources.\" They make up sources.\\nThey\\'re very dishonest people. In fact, in covering my comments, the dishonest media did not explain that I called the fake news the enemy of the people. The fake news. They dropped off the word \"fake.\" And all of a sudden the story became the media is the enemy.\\nThey take the word \"fake\" out. And now I\\'m saying, \"Oh no, this is no good.\" But that\\'s the way they are.\\nSo I\\'m not against the media, I\\'m not against the press. I don\\'t mind bad stories if I deserve them.\\nAnd I tell ya, I love good stories, but we don\\'t go...\\n\\nI don\\'t get too many of them.\\nBut I am only against the fake news, media or press. Fake, fake. They have to leave that word.\\nI\\'m against the people that make up stories and make up sources.\\nThey shouldn\\'t be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody\\'s name. Let their name be put out there. Let their name be put out.\\n\\n\"A source says that Donald Trump is a horrible, horrible human being.\" Let \\'em say it to my face.\\n\\nLet there be no more sources.\\nAnd remember this -- and in not -- in all cases. I mean, I had a story written yesterday about me in Reuters by a very honorable man. It was a very fair story.\\nThere are some great reporters around. They\\'re talented, they\\'re honest as the day is long. They\\'re great.\\nBut there are some terrible dishonest people and they do a tremendous disservice to our country and to our people. A tremendous disservice. They are very dishonest people.\\nAnd they shouldn\\'t use sources. They should put the name of the person. You will see stories dry up like you\\'ve never seen before.\\nSo you have no idea how bad it is, because if you are not part of the story -- and I put myself in your position sometimes. Because many of you, you\\'re not part of the story. And if you\\'re not part of the story, you know, then you, sort of, know -- if you are part of the story, you know what they\\'re saying is true or not.\\n So when they make it up -- and they make up something else, and you saw that before the election: polls, polls. The polls. They come out with these polls and everybody was so surprised.\\nActually, a couple polls got it right. I must say Los Angeles Times did a great job, shocking because, you know, they did a great job.\\n\\nAnd we had a couple of others that were right, but generally speaking, I mean, can tell you the network, somebody said a poll came out. And I say, what network is it? And they\\'ll say, a certain -- let\\'s not even mention names, right? Shall we?\\n\\nWell, you have a lot of them. Look, the Clinton News Network is one.\\n\\nTotally. Take a look. Honestly. Take a look, honestly. Take a look at polls over the last two years. Now you\\'d think they would fire the pollster, right? After years and years of getting battered, but I -- who knows, maybe they are just bad at polling or maybe they\\'re not legit, but it\\'s one or the other, look at how inaccurate -- look at CBS, look at ABC, also, look at NBC, take a look at some of these polls. They\\'re so bad, so inaccurate and what that does is it creates a false narrative.\\nIt creates like this narrative that is just like we\\'re not going to win, people say, I love Trump, but you know, I\\'m not feeling great today, he can\\'t win, so I won\\'t go and vote. I won\\'t go and vote. It creates a whole false deal. And we have to fight it, folks, we have to fight it. They\\'re very smart, they\\'re very cunning and they\\'re very dishonest.\\nSo just to conclude, I mean, it\\'s a very sensitive topic and they get upset when we expose their false stories. They say that we can\\'t criticize their dishonest coverage because of the First Amendment, you know, they always bring up the First Amendment.\\n\\nAnd I love the First Amendment; nobody loves it better than me. Nobody.\\n\\nI mean, who use its more than I do? But the First Amendment gives all of us -- it gives it to me, it gives it to you, it gives it to all Americans, the right to speak our minds freely. It gives you the right and me the right to criticize fake news and criticize it strongly.\\n\\nAnd many of these groups are part the large media corporations that have their own agenda and it\\'s not your agenda and it\\'s not the country\\'s agenda, it\\'s their own agenda. They have a professional obligation as members of the press to report honestly. But as you saw throughout the entire campaign, and even now, the fake news doesn\\'t tell the truth. Doesn\\'t tell the truth.\\nSo just in finishing, I say it doesn\\'t represent the people, it doesn\\'t tell the never will represent the people, and we\\'re going to do something about it because we have to go out and have to speak our minds and we have to be honest. Our victory was a win like nobody has ever seen before.\\n\\nI\\'m here fighting for you and I will continue to fight for you. The victory and the win were something that really was dedicated to a country and people that believe in freedom, security and the rule of law. Our victory...\\n\\n... was a victory and the win for conservative values.\\n\\nAnd our victory was a win for everyone who believes it\\'s time to stand up for America, to stand up for the American worker and to stand up for the American flag.\\n\\nYeah, there we should stand up. Come on. There we should stand up. OK. And by the way, we love our flag. By the way, you folks are in here -- this place is packed, there are lines that go back six blocks and I tell you that because you won\\'t read about it, OK.\\n\\nBut there are lines that go back six blocks, there is such love in this country for everything we stand for, you saw that on Election Day.\\n\\n And you\\'re going to see it more and more.\\n\\nSo we\\'re all part of this very historic movement, a movement the likes of which, actually, the world has never seen before. There\\'s never been anything like this. There\\'s been some movements, but there\\'s never been anything like this.\\nThere\\'s been some movements that petered out like Bernie, petered out.\\n\\nBut it was a little rigged against him, you know, super delegate, super delegate. She had so many delegates before the thing even started, I actually said to my people, how does that happen? Not that I\\'m a fan of Bernie, but a lot of Bernie people voted for Trump, you know why? Because he\\'s right on one issue; trade. He was right about trade. Our country is being absolutely devastated with bad trade deals. So he was right about that, but we got a lot of Bernie support. So actually, I like Bernie. OK? I like Bernie.\\n\\nBut I\\'m here today to tell you what this movement means for the future of the Republican party and for the future of America. First we need to define what this great, great unprecedented movement is and what it actually represents. The core conviction of our movement is that we are a nation that put and will put its own citizens first.\\n\\n\\n For too long, we\\'ve traded away our jobs to other countries. So terrible. We\\'ve defended other nations\\' borders while leaving ours wide open, anybody can come in. We\\'re going to build a wall, don\\'t worry about it. We\\'re building the wall. We\\'re building the wall. In fact, it\\'s going to start soon. Way ahead of schedule, way ahead of schedule.\\n Way, way, way ahead of schedule. It\\'s going to start very soon. General Kelly by the way has done a fantastic job. Fantastic job he\\'s done.\\n\\nAnd remember, we are getting the bad ones out. These are bad dudes. We\\'re getting the bad ones out, OK? We\\'re getting the bad -- if you watch these people, it\\'s like gee, that\\'s so sad. We\\'re getting bad people out of this country, people that shouldn\\'t be whether it\\'s drugs or murder or other things. We\\'re getting bad ones out, those are the ones that go first and I said it from day one. Basically all I\\'ve done is keep my promise.\\n\\nWe\\'ve spent trillions of dollars overseas, while allowing our own infrastructure to fall into total disrepair and decay. In the Middle East, we\\'ve spent as of four weeks ago, $6 trillion. Think of it.\\n\\nAnd by the way, the Middle East is in -- I mean, it\\'s not even close, it\\'s in much worse shape than it was 15 years ago. If our presidents would have gone to the beach for 15 years, we would be in much better shape than we are right now, that I can tell you.\\n\\nBe a hell of a lot better. We could have rebuilt our country three times with that money. This is the situation that I inherited. I inherited a mess, believe me. We also inherited a failed health care law that threatens our medical system with absolute and total catastrophe. Now, I\\'ve been watching and nobody says it, but Obamacare doesn\\'t work, folks. I mean, I could say, I could talk, it doesn\\'t work.\\nAnd now people are starting to develop a little warm heart, but the people that you\\'re watching, they\\'re not you. They\\'re largely -- many of them are the side that lost, you know they lost the election. It\\'s like, how many elections do we have to have? They lost the election. But I always say, Obamacare doesn\\'t work. And these same people two years ago and a year ago were complaining about Obamacare.\\n And the bottom line, we\\'re changing it. We\\'re going to make it much better, we\\'re going to make it less expensive. We\\'re going to make it much better.\\nObamacare covers very few people -- and remember, deduct from the number all of the people that had great health care that they loved that was taken away from them -- it was taken away from them.\\n\\nMillions of people were very happy with their health care, they had their doctor, they had their plan. Remember the lie, 28 times. You could keep your doctor, you could keep your plan. Over and over and over again, you heard it. So we\\'re going to repeal and replace Obamacare.\\n\\nAnd I tell Paul Ryan and all of the folks that we\\'re working with very hard, Dr. Tom Price, very talented guy.\\n\\nBut I tell them from a purely political standpoint, the single best thing we can do is nothing. Let it implode completely, it\\'s already imploding. You see the carriers are all leaving. I mean, it\\'s a disaster. But two years, don\\'t do anything. The Democrats will come to us and beg for help, they\\'ll beg and it\\'s their problem. But it\\'s not the right thing to do for the American people, it\\'s not the right thing to do.\\n\\nWe inherited a national debt that has doubled in eight years, think of it, $20 trillion, it\\'s doubled. We inherited a foreign policy marked by one disaster after another. We don\\'t win anymore. When was the last time we won? Did we win a war? Did we win anything? Do we win anything? We\\'re going to win. We\\'re going on win big, folks. We\\'re going to start winning again, believe me. We\\'re gonna win.\\n\\n But we\\'re taking a firm, bold and decisive measure, we have to, to turn things around. The era of empty talk is over, it\\'s over. \\nNow is the time for action. So let me tell you about the actions that we\\'re taking right now to deliver on our promise to the American people and on my promise to make America great again. We\\'ve taken swift and strong action to secure the southern border of the United States and to begin the construction of a great, great border wall.\\n\\nBy doing this, and with the help of our great border police, with the help of ICE, with the help of General Kelly and all of the people that are so passionate about this -- our border patrol, I\\'ll tell you what they do, they came and endorsed me, ICE came and endorsed me. They never endorsed a presidential candidate before, they might not even be allowed to.\\n\\nBut they were disgusted with what they saw and we\\'ll stop it. We\\'ll stop the drugs from pouring into our nation and poisoning our youth. Pouring in. Pouring in.\\n\\nWe get the drugs, they get the money. We get the problems, they get the cash. No good. No good. Going to stop. By stopping the flow of illegal immigration, we will save countless tax dollars (ph), and that\\'s so important because the tax -- the dollars we\\'re losing are beyond anything that you can imagine. And the tax dollars that can be used to rebuild struggling American communities, including our inner cities.\\n\\nWe are also going to save countless American lives. As we speak today, immigration offers are finding the gang members, the drug dealers and the criminal aliens and throwing them the hell out of our country.\\n\\n And we will not let them back in. They\\'re not coming back in, folks. They do, they\\'re going to have bigger problems than they ever dreamt of.\\n\\nI\\'m also working with the Department of Justice to being reducing violent crime. I mean, can you believe what\\'s happening in Chicago as an example? Two days ago, seven people were shot and I believe killed. Seven people, seven people, Chicago, a great American city, seven people shot and killed. We will support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.\\n\\nThank you, and thank them. I\\'ve also followed through on my campaigning promise and withdrawn America from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\\n\\nSo that we can protect our economic freedom. And we\\'re going to make trade deals, but we\\'re going to do one on one, one on one, and if they misbehave, we terminate the deal and then they\\'ll come back and we\\'ll make a better deal. None of these big quagmire deals that are a disaster.\\nJust take a look -- by the way, take a look at NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever made by any country, having to do with economic development. It\\'s economy un-development, as far as our country is concerned.\\nWe\\'re preparing to repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. We\\'re going to save Americans from this crisis, and give them the access to the quality health care they need and deserve. We have authorized the construction, one day, of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines.\\n\\nAnd issued a new rule -- this took place while I was getting ready to sign. I said who makes the pipes for the pipeline? Well sir, it comes from all over the world, isn\\'t that wonderful? I said nope, comes from the United States, or we\\'re not building it. \\nAmerican steel.\\n\\nIf they want a pipeline in the United States, they\\'re going to use pipe that\\'s made in the United States. Do we agree?\\n\\nBut can you imagine -- I told this story the other day -- can you imagine the gentleman -- never met him, don\\'t even know the name of this company. I actually sort of know it, but I want to get it exactly correct. Big, big powerful company, they spend hundreds of millions of dollars on the pipeline, same thing with the Dakota, different vice. They got their approvals, everything, in the case of Dakota, then all of a sudden they couldn\\'t connect it because they had people protesting that never showed up before.\\nBut with the Keystone -- so they spent hundreds of millions of dollars with bloodsucker consultants -- you know, sucking the blood out of the company, don\\'t worry, I\\'ve used them all my life, OK? Don\\'t worry, we\\'re going to get it approved, I\\'m connected, I\\'m a lobbyist, don\\'t worry. Bottom line, Obama didn\\'t sign it, right? Could be 42,000 jobs, somewhere around there -- a lot of jobs. Didn\\'t sign it.\\nBut can you imagine, he gave up. A year ago, it was dead, now he\\'s doing anything, calling his wife, hello darling, I\\'m a little bored, you know that pipeline that has killed us, that has killed our company. Knock, knock. Mr. so and so, the Keystone Pipeline sir, out of nowhere has just been approved.\\n\\nNow, can you imagine the expression? And you know the sad part? Those same blood sucking consultants that hit them for all the money and failed, they\\'re now going to go back to him and say, did we do a great job; we want more money, right? Because that\\'s the way the system works, a little bit off, but that\\'s the way the system works.\\nWe\\'re preparing bold action to lift the restrictions on American energy, including shale oil, natural gas and beautiful clean coal and we\\'re going to put our miners back to work.\\n\\n Miners are going back to work, folks. Sorry to tell you that, but they\\'re going back to work.\\nWe have begun a historic program to reduce the regulations that are crushing our economy, crushing.\\n\\nAnd not only our economy, crushing our jobs because companies can\\'t hire. We\\'re going to put the regulation industry out of work and out of business.\\n\\nAnd by the way, I want regulation. I want to protect our environment, I want regulations for safety, I want all of the regulations that we need and I want them to be so strong and so tough, but we don\\'t need 75 percent of the repetitive, horrible regulations that hurt companies, hurt jobs, make us non-competitive overseas with other companies from other countries, that we don\\'t need.\\nBut we\\'re going to have regulation. It\\'s going to be really strong and really good and we\\'re going to protect our environment and we\\'re going to protect the safety of our people and our workers, OK?\\n\\nAnother major promise is tax reform. We\\'re going to massively lower taxes on the middle class, reduce taxes on American business and make our tax code more simple and much more fair for everyone, including the people and the business.\\n\\nIn anticipation of these and other changes, jobs are already starting to pour back into our country, you see that. In fact, I think I did more than any other pre-president, they say president- elect. President-elect is meeting with Ford, he\\'s meeting with Chrysler, he\\'s meeting with General Motors. I just wanted to save a little time.\\n\\nBecause Ford and Fiat Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Intel, and so many others are now, because of the election result, making major investments in the United States, expanding production and hiring more workers. And they\\'re going back to Michigan and they\\'re going back to Ohio and they\\'re going back to Pennsylvania and they\\'re going back to North Carolina and to Florida.\\n\\nIt\\'s time for all Americans to get off of welfare and get back to work, you\\'re going to love it, you\\'re going to love it, you\\'re going to love it.\\n\\nWe\\'re also put nothing a massive budget request for our beloved military.\\n\\nAnd we will be substantially upgrading all of our military, all of our military, offensive, defensive, everything, bigger and better and stronger than ever before. And hopefully, we\\'ll never have to use it, but nobody\\'s gonna mess with us, folks, nobody.\\n\\nIt will be one of the greatest military build-ups in American history. No one will dare question as they have been because we\\'re very depleted, very, very depleted. Sequester. Sequester. Nobody will dare question our military might again. We believe in peace through strength and that\\'s what we will have.\\n\\nAs part of my pledge to restore safety for the American people, I have also directed the defense community to develop a plan to totally obliterate ISIS.\\n\\n Working with our allies, we will eradicate this evil from the face of the Earth.\\n\\nAt the same time, we fully understand that national security begins with border security; foreign terrorists will not be able to strike America if they cannot get into our country.\\n\\nBy the way, take a look at what\\'s happening in Europe, folks, take a look at what\\'s happening in Europe. I took a lot of heat on Sweden.\\n\\nAnd then a day later, I said has anybody reported what\\'s going on? And it turned out that they didn\\'t -- not too many of them did. Take a look at what happened in Sweden. I love Sweden, great country, great people, I love Sweden. But they understand. The people over there understand I\\'m right. Take a look at what\\'s happening in Sweden. Take a look at what\\'s happening in Germany. Take a look at what\\'s happened in France. Take a look at Nice and Paris.\\nI have a friend, he\\'s a very, very substantial guy. He loves the city of lights, he loves Paris. For years, every year during the summer, he would go to Paris, was automatic with his wife and his family. Hadn\\'t seen him in a while. And I said, Jim, let me ask you a question, how\\'s Paris doing? \"Paris? I don\\'t go there anymore, Paris is no longer Paris.\" That was four years -- four or five years hasn\\'t gone there. He wouldn\\'t miss it for anything. Now he doesn\\'t even think in terms of going there.\\nTake a look at what\\'s happening to our world, folks. And we have to be smart. We have to be smart. We can\\'t let it happen to us.\\n\\nSo let me state this as clearly as I can, we are going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country.\\n We will not be deterred from this course, and in a matter of days, we will be taking brand-new action to protect our people and keep America safe, you will see the action. I will never ever apologize for protecting the safety and security of the American people, I won\\'t do it.\\n\\nIf it means I get bad press, if it means people speak badly of me, it\\'s OK, doesn\\'t bother me. The security of our people is number one, is number one.\\n\\nOur administration is running with great efficiency, even though I still don\\'t have my Cabinet approved, nobody mentions that.\\n\\nYou know, I still have people out there waiting to be approved and everyone knows they\\'re gonna be approved. It\\'s just a delay, delay, delay, it\\'s really sad, it\\'s really sad. And these are great people, these are some great people. We still don\\'t have our Cabinet. I assume we\\'re setting records for that. That\\'s the only thing good about it is we\\'re setting records. I love setting records.\\n\\nBut I hate having a Cabinet meeting and I see all these empty seats. I said, Democrats, please approve our Cabinet and get smart on health care, too, if you don\\'t mind.\\n\\n\\nBut we\\'re taking meetings everyday with top leaders in business, in science and industry. Yesterday, I had 29 of the biggest business leaders in the world in my office; Caterpillar, Tractor (ph), Campbell\\'s Soup. We had everybody. We had everybody. I like Campbell\\'s Soup.\\n\\n\\nWe had everybody and we came to a lot of very good conclusions and a lot of those folks that are in that room are gonna be building big, big, massive new plants and lots of jobs. And you know what? They\\'re gonna be building them in this country, not in some other country.\\n\\nWe\\'re meeting with unions, meeting with law enforcement and we\\'re meeting with leaders from all around where the White House doors used to be totally closed. They were closed, folks. You don\\'t realize that, they were closed.\\n They\\'re now wide open and they\\'re open for people doing business for our country and putting people to work.\\n\\nAnd when they come into the White House, we\\'re translating these meetings into action. One by one, we\\'re checking off the promises we made to the people of the United States. One by one, a lot of promises. And we will not stop until the job is done. We will reduce your taxes, we will cut your regulations, we will support our police, we will defend our flag.\\n\\nWe will rebuild our military. We will take care of our great, great veterans. We\\'re taking care of our veterans.\\n\\nWe will fix our broken and embarrassing trade deals that are no good. None of them. You wonder where did the people come from that negotiated these deals. Where did they come from? Well, they came also from campaign contributions, I must be honest. They\\'re not as stupid as you think.\\n\\nWe will cut wasteful spending. We will promote our values. We will rebuild our inner cities. We will bring back our jobs and our dreams. So true. So true.\\n\\nAnd by the way, we will protect our Second Amendment.\\n\\nYou know, Wayne and Chris are here from the NRA and they didn\\'t have that on the list. It\\'s lucky I thought about it.\\n\\nBut we will indeed, and they\\'re great people. And by the way, they love our country. They love our country. The NRA has been a great supporter. They love our country.\\n\\nThe forgotten men and women of America will be forgotten no longer. That is the heart of this new movement and the future of the Republican Party. People came to vote, and these people, the media, they said where are they coming from? What\\'s going on here? These are hard-working, great, great Americans. These are unbelievable people who have not been treated fairly. Hillary called them deplorable. They\\'re not deplorable.\\n\\nAUDIENCE: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!\\n Who would have thought that a word was gonna play (ph) so badly?\\n\\nThat\\'s the problem in politics. One wrong word and it\\'s over. She also said irredeemable, but we won\\'t mention that.\\n\\nThe GOP will be, from now on, the party also of the American worker.\\n\\nYou know, we haven\\'t been as a group given credit for this, but if you look at how much bigger our party has gotten during this cycle, during the early days when we had 17 people running in the primaries. Millions and millions of people were joining. Now, I won\\'t say it was because of me, but it was. OK?\\n\\n\\nAnd we have an amazing, strong, powerful party that truly does want to see America be great again, and it will see it and it\\'s gonna see it a lot sooner than you think, believe me, a lot sooner than you think.\\n\\n We will not answer to donors or lobbyists, or special interests, but we will serve the citizens of the United States of America, believe me.\\n\\nGlobal cooperation, dealing with other countries, getting along with other countries is good, it\\'s very important. But there is no such thing as a global anthem, a global currency or a global flag. This is the United States of America that I\\'m representing.\\n\\nI\\'m not representing the globe, I\\'m representing your country.\\n\\n\\n There\\'s one allegiance that unites us all, and that is to America. America, it\\'s the allegiance to America.\\n\\nNo matter our background or income, or geography, we\\'re all citizens of this blessed land. And no matter our color or the blood -- the color of the blood we bleed, it\\'s the same red blood of great, great patriots. Remember, great patriots.\\n\\nWe all salute with pride, the same American flag, and we all are equal -- totally equal in the eyes of almighty God, we\\'re equal.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nAnd I want to thank, by the way, the Evangelical community, the Christian community.\\n Communities of faith, rabbis and priests and pastors, ministers, because the support for me was a record, as you know, not only in terms of numbers of people, but percentage of those numbers that voted for Trump. So I want to thank you folks, that was amazing -- an amazing outpour...\\n\\n... and I will not disappoint you. As long as we have faith in each other and trust in God, then there is no goal at all beyond our reach.

We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done.\\n\\nEvery four years we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power.\\n\\nAnd we are grateful to President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition.\\n\\nThey have been magnificent.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nToday\\'s ceremony, however, has a very special meaning because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C., and giving it back to you, the people.\\n\\nFor too long, a small group in our nation\\'s capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have bore the cost. Washington flourished, but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered but the jobs left and the factories closed.\\n\\nThe establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your triumphs. And while they celebrated in our nation\\'s capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.\\n\\nThat all changes starting right here and right now, because this moment is your moment.\\n\\nIt belongs to you.\\n\\nIt belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America.\\n\\nThis is your day.\\n\\nThis is your celebration.\\n\\nAnd this, the United States of America, is your country.\\n\\nWhat truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.\\n\\nJanuary 20th, 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.\\n\\nThe forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. Everyone is listening to you now. You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement, the likes of which the world has never seen before.\\n\\nAt the center of this movement is a crucial conviction that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families and good jobs for themselves.\\n\\nThese are just and reasonable demands of righteous people and a righteous public.\\n\\nBut for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists.\\n\\nMothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities, rusted out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation.\\n\\nAn education system flush with cash but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge.\\n\\nAnd the crime and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential. This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.\\n\\nWe are one nation, and their pain is our pain.\\n\\nTheir dreams are our dreams, and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home and one glorious destiny.\\n\\nThe oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans.\\n\\nFor many decades we\\'ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry, subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military.\\n\\nWe\\'ve defended other nations\\' borders while refusing to defend our own. And we\\'ve spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas while America\\'s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay.\\n\\nWe\\'ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has dissipated over the horizon.\\n\\nOne by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores with not even a thought about the millions and millions of American workers that were left behind.\\n\\nThe wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world. But that is the past, and now we are looking only to the future.\\n\\nWe assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital and in every hall of power. From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.\\n\\nFrom this day forward, it\\'s going to be only America first, America first. Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our product, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs.\\n\\nProtection will lead to great prosperity and strength. I will fight for you with every breath in my body, and I will never ever let you down.\\n\\nAmerica will start winning again, winning like never before.\\n\\nWe will bring back our jobs.\\n\\nWe will bring back our borders.\\n\\nWe will bring back our wealth, and we will bring back our dreams.\\n\\nWe will build new roads and highways and bridges and airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation.\\n\\nWe will get our people off of welfare and back to work, rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.\\n\\nWe will follow two simple rules: Buy American and hire American.\\n\\nWe will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world, but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.\\n\\nWe do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example.\\n\\nWe will shine for everyone to follow.\\n\\nWe will re-enforce old alliances and form new ones and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the earth.\\n\\nAt the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.\\n\\nWhen you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.\\n\\nThe Bible tells us how good and pleasant it is when God\\'s people live together in unity. We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity. When America is united, America is totally unstoppable. There should be no fear. We are protected and we will always be protected. We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement. And most importantly, we will be protected by God.\\n\\nFinally, we must think big and dream even bigger. In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving. We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action, constantly complaining but never doing anything about it.\\n\\nThe time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action.\\n\\nDo not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America. We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again.\\n\\nWe stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.\\n\\nA new national pride will stir ourselves, lift our sights and heal our divisions. It\\'s time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget, that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots.\\n\\nWe all enjoy the same glorious freedoms and we all salute the same great American flag.\\n\\nAnd whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty creator.\\n\\nSo to all Americans in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean, hear these words: You will never be ignored again. Your voice, your hopes and your dreams will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.\\n\\nTogether we will make America strong again, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again.\\n\\nAnd, yes, together we will make America great again.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nGod bless you.\\n\\nAnd God bless America.\"'), ('Trump Congressional Address.txt', 'Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and Citizens of America:\\nTonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our Nation\\'s path toward civil rights and the work that still remains. Recent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week\\'s shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a Nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms.\\nEach American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice --- in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present.\\nThat torch is now in our hands. And we will use it to light up the world. I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.\\nA new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning.\\nA new national pride is sweeping across our Nation.\\nAnd a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.\\nWhat we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American Spirit.\\nOur allies will find that America is once again ready to lead.\\nAll the nations of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free.\\nIn 9 years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding -- 250 years since the day we declared our Independence.\\nIt will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world.\\nBut what will America look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we leave for our children?\\nI will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future.\\nFor too long, we\\'ve watched our middle class shrink as we\\'ve exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries.\\nWe\\'ve financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit -- and so many other places throughout our land.\\nWe\\'ve defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own borders wide open, for anyone to cross -- and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate.\\nAnd we\\'ve spent trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.\\nThen, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds --- families who just wanted a fair shot for their children, and a fair hearing for their concerns.\\nBut then the quiet voices became a loud chorus -- as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.\\nFinally, the chorus became an earthquake -- and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand, that America must put its own citizens first ... because only then, can we truly MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.\\nDying industries will come roaring back to life. Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need.\\nOur military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve.\\nCrumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our beautiful land.\\nOur terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately, stop.\\nAnd our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity.\\nAbove all else, we will keep our promises to the American people.\\nIt\\'s been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the Nation on the progress I\\'ve made in keeping those promises.\\nSince my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart, and many others, have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.\\nThe stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in value since the election on November 8th, a record. We\\'ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of the fantastic new F-35 jet fighter, and will be saving billions more dollars on contracts all across our Government. We have placed a hiring freeze on non-military and non-essential Federal workers.\\nWe have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a 5 year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials --- and a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government.\\nWe have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job‑crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every Government agency; imposing a new rule which mandates that for every 1 new regulation, 2 old regulations must be eliminated; and stopping a regulation that threatens the future and livelihoods of our great coal miners.\\nWe have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines -- thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs -- and I\\'ve issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel.\\nWe have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.\\nWith the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a Council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.\\nTo protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime.\\nI have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread across our Nation.\\nWe will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth -- and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.\\nAt the same time, my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security. By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone. We want all Americans to succeed --- but that can\\'t happen in an environment of lawless chaos. We must restore integrity and the rule of law to our borders.\\nFor that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great wall along our southern border. It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a very effective weapon against drugs and crime.\\nAs we speak, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens. Bad ones are going out as I speak tonight and as I have promised.\\nTo any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this question: what would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or a loved one, because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders?\\nOur obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States. We are also taking strong measures to protect our Nation from Radical Islamic Terrorism.\\nAccording to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home --- from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and yes, even the World Trade Center.\\nWe have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world.\\nIt is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.\\nWe cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America -- we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.\\nThat is why my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our Nation safe -- and to keep out those who would do us harm.\\nAs promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS -- a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women, and children of all faiths and beliefs. We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.\\nI have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran\\'s ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel.\\nFinally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States Supreme Court -- from my list of 20 judges -- who will defend our Constitution. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice. To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill, and deep devotion to the law. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination.\\nTonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited.\\nNinety-four million Americans are out of the labor force.\\nOver 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps.\\nMore than 1 in 5 people in their prime working years are not working.\\nWe have the worst financial recovery in 65 years.\\nIn the last 8 years, the past Administration has put on more new debt than nearly all other Presidents combined.\\nWe\\'ve lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was approved, and we\\'ve lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.\\nOur trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion dollars.\\nAnd overseas, we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.\\nSolving these, and so many other pressing problems, will require us to work past the differences of party. It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.\\nBut to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy -- making it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much harder for companies to leave.\\nRight now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world.\\nMy economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.\\nWe must create a level playing field for American companies and workers.\\nCurrently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes -- but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them almost nothing.\\nI just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson. In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House.\\nAt our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business? They said that it\\'s good. I asked them further how they are doing with other countries, mainly international sales. They told me -- without even complaining because they have been mistreated for so long that they have become used to it -- that it is very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate. They said that in one case another country taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.\\nThey weren\\'t even asking for change. But I am.\\nI believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be FAIR TRADE.\\nThe first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that the \"abandonment of the protective policy by the American Government [will] produce want and ruin among our people.\"\\nLincoln was right -- and it is time we heeded his words. I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore.\\nI am going to bring back millions of jobs. Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration. The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers.\\nNations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others --- have a merit-based immigration system. It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon. According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs America\\'s taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.\\nSwitching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, will have many benefits: it will save countless dollars, raise workers\\' wages, and help struggling families --- including immigrant families --- enter the middle class.\\nI believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation\\'s security, and to restore respect for our laws.\\nIf we are guided by the well-being of American citizens then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.\\nAnother Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program --- the building of the interstate highway system. The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding.\\nAmerica has spent approximately six trillion dollars in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. With this six trillion dollars we could have rebuilt our country --- twice. And maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.\\nTo launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in the infrastructure of the United States -- financed through both public and private capital --- creating millions of new jobs.\\nThis effort will be guided by two core principles: Buy American, and Hire American.\\nTonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better Healthcare.\\nMandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for America. The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do.\\nObamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits. As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone. Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his State -- it is unsustainable and collapsing.\\nOne third of counties have only one insurer on the exchanges --- leaving many Americans with no choice at all.\\nRemember when you were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?\\nWe now know that all of those promises have been broken.\\nObamacare is collapsing --- and we must act decisively to protect all Americans. Action is not a choice --- it is a necessity.\\nSo I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.\\nHere are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a better healthcare system for all Americans:\\nFirst, we should ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges.\\nSecondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts --- but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by the Government.\\nThirdly, we should give our great State Governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.\\nFourthly, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance -- and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately.\\nFinally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across State lines --- creating a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring cost way down and provide far better care.\\nEverything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing, and hope.\\nOur citizens deserve this, and so much more --- so why not join forces to finally get it done? On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and for the good of the American people.\\nMy administration wants to work with members in both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents have paid family leave, to invest in women\\'s health, and to promote clean air and clear water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.\\nTrue love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a brighter future.\\nAn incredible young woman is with us this evening who should serve as an inspiration to us all.\\nToday is Rare Disease day, and joining us in the gallery is a Rare Disease Survivor, Megan Crowley. Megan was diagnosed with Pompe Disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past 5.\\nOn receiving this news, Megan\\'s dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved Megan\\'s life. Today she is 20 years old -- and a sophomore at Notre Dame.\\nMegan\\'s story is about the unbounded power of a father\\'s love for a daughter.\\nBut our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan\\'s life, from reaching those in need.\\nIf we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA but across our Government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.\\nIn fact, our children will grow up in a Nation of miracles.\\nBut to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind --- and the souls --- of every American child.\\nEducation is the civil rights issue of our time.\\nI am calling upon Members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African-American and Latino children. These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them.\\nJoining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice. But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning, with the help of a tax credit scholarship program. Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college. Later this year she will get her masters degree in social work.\\nWe want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.\\nBut to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.\\nThe murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century.\\nIn Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone --- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.\\nThis is not acceptable in our society.\\nEvery American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job.\\nBut to create this future, we must work with --- not against --- the men and women of law enforcement.\\nWe must build bridges of cooperation and trust --- not drive the wedge of disunity and division.\\nPolice and sheriffs are members of our community. They are friends and neighbors, they are mothers and fathers, sons and daughters -- and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry whether or not they\\'ll come home safe and sound.\\nWe must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.\\nAnd we must support the victims of crime.\\nI have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. The office is called VOICE --- Victims Of Immigration Crime Engagement. We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests.\\nJoining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.\\nTheir names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis.\\nJamiel\\'s 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison. Jamiel Shaw Jr. was an incredible young man, with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college where he would have excelled as a great quarterback. But he never got the chance. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a good friend of mine.\\nAlso with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis. Their husbands --- Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis --- were slain in the line of duty in California. They were pillars of their community. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.\\nSitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna. Jenna: I want you to know that your father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you.\\nTo Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica: I want you to know --- we will never stop fighting for justice. Your loved ones will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory.\\nFinally, to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war and --- if they must --- to fight and to win.\\nI am sending the Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the Defense sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.\\nMy budget will also increase funding for our veterans.\\nOur veterans have delivered for this Nation --- and now we must deliver for them.\\nThe challenges we face as a Nation are great. But our people are even greater.\\nAnd none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform.\\nWe are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U.S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William \"Ryan\" Owens. Ryan died as he lived: a warrior, and a hero --- battling against terrorism and securing our Nation.\\nI just spoke to General Mattis, who reconfirmed that, and I quote, \"Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies.\" Ryan\\'s legacy is etched into eternity. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one\\'s life for one\\'s friends. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom --- we will never forget him.\\nTo those allies who wonder what kind of friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform.\\nOur foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world. It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies across the globe.\\nWe strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two World Wars that dethroned fascism, and a Cold War that defeated communism.\\nBut our partners must meet their financial obligations.\\nAnd now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.\\nWe expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, or the Pacific --- to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost.\\nWe will respect historic institutions, but we will also respect the sovereign rights of nations.\\nFree nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people --- and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America. But we know that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more.\\nWe must learn from the mistakes of the past --- we have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world.\\nThe only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long process of rebuilding.\\nAmerica is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align. We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict.\\nWe want peace, wherever peace can be found. America is friends today with former enemies. Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these World Wars. This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.\\nHopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free.\\nOn our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our Nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America\\'s centennial. At that celebration, the country\\'s builders and artists and inventors showed off their creations.\\nAlexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time.\\nRemington unveiled the first typewriter. An early attempt was made at electric light.\\nThomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen.\\nImagine the wonders our country could know in America\\'s 250th year.\\nThink of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people.\\nCures to illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.\\nAmerican footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.\\nMillions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect.\\nAnd streets where mothers are safe from fear -- schools where children learn in peace -- and jobs where Americans prosper and grow -- are not too much to ask.\\nWhen we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before. For all Americans.\\nThis is our vision. This is our mission.\\nBut we can only get there together.\\nWe are one people, with one destiny.\\nWe all bleed the same blood.\\nWe all salute the same flag.\\nAnd we are all made by the same God.\\nAnd when we fulfill this vision; when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began.\\nThe time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us.\\nWe just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts.\\nThe bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls.\\nAnd the confidence to turn those hopes and dreams to action.\\nFrom now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears ---\\ninspired by the future, not bound by the failures of the past ---\\nand guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.\\nI am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American Spirit. I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country. And I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment and --\\nBelieve in yourselves.\\nBelieve in your future.\\nAnd believe, once more, in America.\\nThank you, God bless you, and God Bless these United States.'), ('Trump Nomination Speech.txt', \"Friends, delegates and fellow Americans: I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States.\\n\\n\\nTogether, we will lead our party back to the White House, and we will lead our country back to safety, prosperity, and peace. We will be a country of generosity and warmth. But we will also be a country of law and order.\\n\\nOur Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation. The attacks on our police, and the terrorism in our cities, threaten our very way of life. Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country.\\n\\nAmericans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities. Many have witnessed this violence personally, some have even been its victims.\\n\\nI have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon come to an end. Beginning on January 20th 2017, safety will be restored.\\n\\nThe most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens. Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead.\\n\\nIt is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation.\\n\\nI will present the facts plainly and honestly. We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.\\n\\nSo if you want to hear the corporate spin, the carefully-crafted lies, and the media myths the Democrats are holding their convention next week.\\n\\nBut here, at our convention, there will be no lies. We will honor the American people with the truth, and nothing else.\\n\\n\\n\\nDecades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administration’s rollback of criminal enforcement.\\n\\nHomicides last year increased by 17% in America’s fifty largest cities. That’s the largest increase in 25 years. In our nation’s capital, killings have risen by 50 percent. They are up nearly 60% in nearby Baltimore.\\n\\nIn the President’s hometown of Chicago, more than 2,000 have been the victims of shootings this year alone. And more than 3,600 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office.\\n\\nThe number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50% compared to this point last year. Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens.\\n\\nThe number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015. They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources.\\n\\nOne such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska. There, he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root. She was 21 years-old, and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 Grade Point Average. Her killer was then released a second time, and he is now a fugitive from the law.\\n\\nI’ve met Sarah’s beautiful family. But to this Administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn’t worth protecting. One more child to sacrifice on the altar of open borders. What about our economy?\\n\\nAgain, I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper: Nearly Four in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African American youth are not employed. 2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when the President took his oath of office less than eight years ago. Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely.\\n\\nHousehold incomes are down more than $4,000 since the year 2000. Our manufacturing trade deficit has reached an all-time high – nearly $800 billion in a single year. The budget is no better.\\n\\nPresident Obama has doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion, and growing. Yet, what do we have to show for it? Our roads and bridges are falling apart, our airports are in Third World condition, and forty-three million Americans are on food stamps.\\n\\nNow let us consider the state of affairs abroad.\\n\\nNot only have our citizens endured domestic disaster, but they have lived through one international humiliation after another. We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint.\\n\\nThis was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal, which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us nothing – it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever made. Another humiliation came when president Obama drew a red line in Syria – and the whole world knew it meant nothing.\\n\\nIn Libya, our consulate – the symbol of American prestige around the globe – was brought down in flames. America is far less safe – and the world is far less stable – than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of America’s foreign policy.\\n\\nI am certain it is a decision he truly regrets. Her bad instincts and her bad judgment – something pointed out by Bernie Sanders – are what caused the disasters unfolding today. Let’s review the record. In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map.\\n\\nLibya was cooperating. Egypt was peaceful. Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Syria was under control. After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have? ISIS has spread across the region, and the world. Libya is in ruins, and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers. Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood, forcing the military to retake control. Iraq is in chaos.\\n\\nIran is on the path to nuclear weapons. Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis that now threatens the West. After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East, after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost, the situation is worse than it has ever been before.\\n\\nThis is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death, destruction and weakness.\\n\\nBut Hillary Clinton’s legacy does not have to be America’s legacy. The problems we face now – poverty and violence at home, war and destruction abroad – will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them. A change in leadership is required to change these outcomes. Tonight, I will share with you my plan of action for America.\\n\\nThe most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents, is that our plan will put America First. Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo. As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect. This will all change in 2017.\\n\\nThe American People will come first once again. My plan will begin with safety at home – which means safe neighborhoods, secure borders, and protection from terrorism. There can be no prosperity without law and order. On the economy, I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America.\\n\\nA number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation’s most powerful special interests. That is because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit.\\n\\nBig business, elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place. They are throwing money at her because they have total control over everything she does. She is their puppet, and they pull the strings.\\n\\nThat is why Hillary Clinton’s message is that things will never change. My message is that things have to change – and they have to change right now. Every day I wake up determined to deliver for the people I have met all across this nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned.\\n\\nI have visited the laid-off factory workers, and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals. These are the forgotten men and women of our country. People who work hard but no longer have a voice.\\n\\nI AM YOUR VOICE.\\n\\nI have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good. I have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.\\n\\nWhen innocent people suffer, because our political system lacks the will, or the courage, or the basic decency to enforce our laws – or worse still, has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash – I am not able to look the other way.\\n\\nAnd when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server, deletes 33,000 of them so the authorities can’t see her crime, puts our country at risk, lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence – I know that corruption has reached a level like never before.\\n\\nWhen the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was “extremely careless” and “negligent,” in handling our classified secrets, I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did. They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible crimes.\\n\\nIn fact, her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such an egregious crime and getting away with it – especially when others have paid so dearly. When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers I know the time for action has come.\\n\\nI have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves. Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it. I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens, just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders – he never had a chance.\\n\\nBut his supporters will join our movement, because we will fix his biggest issue: trade. Millions of Democrats will join our movement because we are going to fix the system so it works for all Americans. In this cause, I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana.\\n\\nWe will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to Indiana. He is a man of character and accomplishment. He is the right man for the job. The first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities.\\n\\nAmerica was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were brutally executed. In the days after Dallas, we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials. Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia, Missouri, Wisconsin, Kansas, Michigan and Tennessee.\\n\\nOn Sunday, more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Three were killed, and four were badly injured. An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans. I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: when I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order our country.\\n\\nI will work with, and appoint, the best prosecutors and law enforcement officials in the country to get the job done. In this race for the White House, I am the Law And Order candidate. The irresponsible rhetoric of our President, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment for everyone.\\n\\nThis Administration has failed America’s inner cities. It’s failed them on education. It’s failed them on jobs. It’s failed them on crime. It’s failed them at every level.\\n\\nWhen I am President, I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally, and protected equally.\\n\\nEvery action I take, I will ask myself: does this make life better for young Americans in Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Ferguson who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child America?\\n\\nTo make life safe in America, we must also address the growing threats we face from outside America: we are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS. Once again, France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism.\\n\\nMen, women and children viciously mowed down. Lives ruined. Families ripped apart. A nation in mourning.\\n\\nThe damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been over and over – at the World Trade Center, at an office party in San Bernardino, at the Boston Marathon, and a military recruiting center in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\\n\\nOnly weeks ago, in Orlando, Florida, 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist. This time, the terrorist targeted our LGBT community. As your President, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBT citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology. To protect us from terrorism, we need to focus on three things.\\n\\nWe must have the best intelligence gathering operation in the world. We must abandon the failed policy of nation building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria. Instead, we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terror.\\n\\nThis includes working with our greatest ally in the region, the State of Israel. Lastly, we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place.\\n\\nMy opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under President Obama. She proposes this despite the fact that there’s no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from. I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people.\\n\\nAnyone who endorses violence, hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never will be.\\n\\nDecades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers. We are going to have an immigration system that works, but one that works for the American people.\\n\\nOn Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and Jamiel Shaw. They are just three brave representatives of many thousands. Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more deeply than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our border.\\n\\nThese families have no special interests to represent them. There are no demonstrators to protest on their behalf. My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain. Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities. But where was sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, Sabine and Jamiel? Where was sanctuary for all the other Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so horribly?\\n\\nThese wounded American families have been alone. But they are alone no longer. Tonight, this candidate and this whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering the same awful fate.\\n\\nWe are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities. I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America’s Border Patrol Agents, and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful immigration system.\\n\\nBy ending catch-and-release on the border, we will stop the cycle of human smuggling and violence. Illegal border crossings will go down. Peace will be restored. By enforcing the rules for the millions who overstay their visas, our laws will finally receive the respect they deserve.\\n\\nTonight, I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied – and every politician who has denied them – to listen very closely to the words I am about to say.\\n\\nOn January 21st of 2017, the day after I take the oath of office, Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced. We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone.\\n\\nBut my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens. My plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton. Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration. Communities want relief.\\n\\nYet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty, mass immigration, and mass lawlessness. Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals, further reduce your jobs and wages, and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape from poverty.\\n\\nI have a different vision for our workers. It begins with a new, fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat. It’s been a signature message of my campaign from day one, and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office.\\n\\nI have made billions of dollars in business making deals – now I’m going to make our country rich again. I am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great ones. America has lost nearly-one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton.\\n\\nRemember, it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA, one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country.\\n\\nNever again.\\n\\nI am going to bring our jobs back to Ohio and to America – and I am not going to let companies move to other countries, firing their employees along the way, without consequences.\\n\\nMy opponent, on the other hand, has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class. She supported NAFTA, and she supported China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization – another one of her husband’s colossal mistakes.\\n\\nShe supported the job killing trade deal with South Korea. She has supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The TPP will not only destroy our manufacturing, but it will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments. I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers, or that diminishes our freedom and independence. Instead, I will make individual deals with individual countries.\\n\\nNo longer will we enter into these massive deals, with many countries, that are thousands of pages long – and which no one from our country even reads or understands. We are going to enforce all trade violations, including through the use of taxes and tariffs, against any country that cheats.\\n\\nThis includes stopping China’s outrageous theft of intellectual property, along with their illegal product dumping, and their devastating currency manipulation. Our horrible trade agreements with China and many others, will be totally renegotiated. That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a much better deal for America – and we’ll walk away if we don’t get the deal that we want. We are going to start building and making things again.\\n\\nNext comes the reform of our tax laws, regulations and energy rules. While Hillary Clinton plans a massive tax increase, I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has declared for the presidential race this year – Democrat or Republican. Middle-income Americans will experience profound relief, and taxes will be simplified for everyone.\\n\\nAmerica is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world. Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country. Then we are going to deal with the issue of regulation, one of the greatest job-killers of them all. Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year, and we will end it. We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy. This will produce more than $20 trillion in job creating economic activity over the next four decades.\\n\\nMy opponent, on the other hand, wants to put the great miners and steel workers of our country out of work – that will never happen when I am President. With these new economic policies, trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country.\\n\\nThis new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans – We will build the roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and the railways of tomorrow. This, in turn, will create millions more jobs. We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice.\\n\\nMy opponent would rather protect education bureaucrats than serve American children. We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare. You will be able to choose your own doctor again. And we will fix TSA at the airports! We will completely rebuild our depleted military, and the countries that we protect, at a massive loss, will be asked to pay their fair share.\\n\\nWe will take care of our great Veterans like they have never been taken care of before. My opponent dismissed the VA scandal as being not widespread – one more sign of how out of touch she really is. We are going to ask every Department Head in government to provide a list of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days. The politicians have talked about it, I’m going to do it. We are also going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our Constitution.\\n\\nThe replacement for Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views and principles. This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election. My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment. I, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association and will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe.\\n\\nAt this moment, I would like to thank the evangelical community who have been so good to me and so supportive. You have so much to contribute to our politics, yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits.\\n\\nAn amendment, pushed by Lyndon Johnson, many years ago, threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views.\\n\\nI am going to work very hard to repeal that language and protect free speech for all Americans. We can accomplish these great things, and so much else – all we need to do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again. It is time to show the whole world that America Is Back – bigger, and better and stronger than ever before.\\n\\nIn this journey, I'm so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my wonderful children, Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, and Barron: you will always be my greatest source of pride and joy. My Dad, Fred Trump, was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew. I wonder sometimes what he’d say if he were here to see this tonight.\\n\\nIt’s because of him that I learned, from my youngest age, to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people. He was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers, carpenters, and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also. Then there’s my mother, Mary. She was strong, but also warm and fair-minded. She was a truly great mother. She was also one of the most honest and charitable people I have ever known, and a great judge of character.\\n\\nTo my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth, my brother Robert and my late brother Fred, I will always give you my love you are most special to me. I have loved my life in business.\\n\\nBut now, my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country – to go to work for all of you. It’s time to deliver a victory for the American people. But to do that, we must break free from the petty politics of the past.\\n\\nAmerica is a nation of believers, dreamers, and strivers that is being led by a group of censors, critics, and cynics.\\n\\nRemember: all of the people telling you that you can’t have the country you want, are the same people telling you that I wouldn’t be standing here tonight. No longer can we rely on those elites in media, and politics, who will say anything to keep a rigged system in place.\\n\\nInstead, we must choose to Believe In America. History is watching us now.\\n\\nIt’s waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion, and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong.\\n\\nMy opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge. It reads: “I’m With Her”. I choose to recite a different pledge.\\n\\nMy pledge reads: “I’M WITH YOU – THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.”\\n\\nI am your voice.\\n\\nSo to every parent who dreams for their child, and every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I’m With You, and I will fight for you, and I will win for you.\\n\\nTo all Americans tonight, in all our cities and towns, I make this promise: We Will Make America Strong Again.\\n\\nWe Will Make America Proud Again.\\n\\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\\n\\nAnd We Will Make America Great Again.\\n\\nTHANK YOU.\"), ('Trump CPAC Speech.txt', ' Thank you, everybody. So great to be with you. Thank you. \\nGreat to be back at CPAC. It\\'s a place I have really...\\n\\n I love this place.\\n\\nLove you people. So thank you -- thank you very much.\\nFirst of all, I want to thank Matt Schlapp and his very, very incredible wife, and boss, Mercedes, who have been fantastic friends and supporters and so great. When I watch them on television defending me, nobody has a chance.\\nSo I want to thank Matt and Mercedes.\\n\\nAnd when Matt called and asked I said, \"Absolutely I\\'ll be there with you.\" I mean, the real reason I said it, I didn\\'t want him to go against me cause that...\\n\\n... that one you can\\'t beat.\\nSo I said absolutely.\\nAnd it really is an honor to be here. I wouldn\\'t miss a chance to talk to my friends. These are my friends.\\n\\nAnd we\\'ll see you again next year and the year after that and I\\'ll be doing this...\\n\\n... I\\'ll be doing this with CPAC whenever I can and I\\'ll make sure that we\\'re here a lot.\\n\\n You know if you remember my first major speech -- sit down everybody. C\\'mon.\\n\\nYou know the dishonest media they\\'ll say, \"He didn\\'t get a standing ovation.\" You know why?\\n\\nNo -- you know why? Because everybody stood and nobody sat. So they will say, \"He never got a standing ovation,\" right? \\nThey are the worst.\\n\\n\\n So -- sit down.\\n\\n\"Donald Trump did not get a standing ovation.\"\\n\\nThey leave out the part, \"They never sat down.\" They leave that out.\\nSo I just want to thank -- but you know my first major speak was at CPAC and -- probably five or six years ago. First major political speech. And you were there. And it was -- I loved it. I loved the people. I loved the commotion.\\nAnd then they did these polls were I went through the roof and I wasn\\'t even running, right?\\n\\nBut it gave me an idea. And I got a little bit concerned when I saw what was happening in the country. And I said, \"Let\\'s go to it.\"\\nSo, it was very exciting. I walked the stage on CPAC. I\\'ll never forget it, really. I had very little notes and even less preparation. So when you have practically no notes and no preparation and then you leave and everybody was thrilled, I said, \"I think I like this business.\"\\nRead More: President Trump Just Boasted About Winning Polls at CPAC. He Lost 6 Times\\n\\nI would\\'ve come last year but I was worried that I would be, at that time, too controversial. We wanted border security. We wanted very, very strong military. We wanted all of the things that we\\'re going to get...\\n\\n... and people consider that controversial but you didn\\'t consider it controversial.\\n\\n So, I\\'ve been with CPAC for a long time. All of these years we\\'ve been together. And now you finally have a president, finally. Took you a long time.\\n\\nTook you a long time.\\n\\nAnd it\\'s patriots like you that made it happen, believe me. Believe me.\\nYou did it because you love your country, because you want a better future for your children and because you want to make America great again.\\n\\nThe media didn\\'t think we would win. The...\\n ... pundits -- you\\'re right. They had an idea.\\nThe pundits didn\\'t think we\\'d win. The consultants that suck up all that money -- oh, they suck it up. They\\'re so good.\\n\\nThey\\'re not good at politics, but they\\'re really good at sucking up people\\'s money. Especially my opponents, because I kept them down to a minimum.\\nBut the consultants didn\\'t think we would win.\\nBut they all underestimated the power of the people: You. And the people proved them...\\n\\n... totally wrong. Never -- and -- and this is so true. And this is what\\'s been happening. Never underestimate the people. Never.\\n\\nI don\\'t think it\\'ll ever happen again.\\nAnd I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news. It\\'s fake, phony, fake.\\n\\nA few days ago I called the fake news the enemy of the people. And they are. They are the enemy of the people.\\n\\nBecause they have no sources, they just make \\'em up when there are none. I saw one story recently where they said, \"Nine people have confirmed.\" There\\'re no nine people. I don\\'t believe there was one or two people. Nine people.\\nAnd I said, \"Give me a break.\" Because I know the people, I know who they talk to. There were no nine people.\\nBut they say \"nine people.\" And somebody reads it and they think, \"Oh, nine people. They have nine sources.\" They make up sources.\\nThey\\'re very dishonest people. In fact, in covering my comments, the dishonest media did not explain that I called the fake news the enemy of the people. The fake news. They dropped off the word \"fake.\" And all of a sudden the story became the media is the enemy.\\nThey take the word \"fake\" out. And now I\\'m saying, \"Oh no, this is no good.\" But that\\'s the way they are.\\nSo I\\'m not against the media, I\\'m not against the press. I don\\'t mind bad stories if I deserve them.\\nAnd I tell ya, I love good stories, but we don\\'t go...\\n\\nI don\\'t get too many of them.\\nBut I am only against the fake news, media or press. Fake, fake. They have to leave that word.\\nI\\'m against the people that make up stories and make up sources.\\nThey shouldn\\'t be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody\\'s name. Let their name be put out there. Let their name be put out.\\n\\n\"A source says that Donald Trump is a horrible, horrible human being.\" Let \\'em say it to my face.\\n\\nLet there be no more sources.\\nAnd remember this -- and in not -- in all cases. I mean, I had a story written yesterday about me in Reuters by a very honorable man. It was a very fair story.\\nThere are some great reporters around. They\\'re talented, they\\'re honest as the day is long. They\\'re great.\\nBut there are some terrible dishonest people and they do a tremendous disservice to our country and to our people. A tremendous disservice. They are very dishonest people.\\nAnd they shouldn\\'t use sources. They should put the name of the person. You will see stories dry up like you\\'ve never seen before.\\nSo you have no idea how bad it is, because if you are not part of the story -- and I put myself in your position sometimes. Because many of you, you\\'re not part of the story. And if you\\'re not part of the story, you know, then you, sort of, know -- if you are part of the story, you know what they\\'re saying is true or not.\\n So when they make it up -- and they make up something else, and you saw that before the election: polls, polls. The polls. They come out with these polls and everybody was so surprised.\\nActually, a couple polls got it right. I must say Los Angeles Times did a great job, shocking because, you know, they did a great job.\\n\\nAnd we had a couple of others that were right, but generally speaking, I mean, can tell you the network, somebody said a poll came out. And I say, what network is it? And they\\'ll say, a certain -- let\\'s not even mention names, right? Shall we?\\n\\nWell, you have a lot of them. Look, the Clinton News Network is one.\\n\\nTotally. Take a look. Honestly. Take a look, honestly. Take a look at polls over the last two years. Now you\\'d think they would fire the pollster, right? After years and years of getting battered, but I -- who knows, maybe they are just bad at polling or maybe they\\'re not legit, but it\\'s one or the other, look at how inaccurate -- look at CBS, look at ABC, also, look at NBC, take a look at some of these polls. They\\'re so bad, so inaccurate and what that does is it creates a false narrative.\\nIt creates like this narrative that is just like we\\'re not going to win, people say, I love Trump, but you know, I\\'m not feeling great today, he can\\'t win, so I won\\'t go and vote. I won\\'t go and vote. It creates a whole false deal. And we have to fight it, folks, we have to fight it. They\\'re very smart, they\\'re very cunning and they\\'re very dishonest.\\nSo just to conclude, I mean, it\\'s a very sensitive topic and they get upset when we expose their false stories. They say that we can\\'t criticize their dishonest coverage because of the First Amendment, you know, they always bring up the First Amendment.\\n\\nAnd I love the First Amendment; nobody loves it better than me. Nobody.\\n\\nI mean, who use its more than I do? But the First Amendment gives all of us -- it gives it to me, it gives it to you, it gives it to all Americans, the right to speak our minds freely. It gives you the right and me the right to criticize fake news and criticize it strongly.\\n\\nAnd many of these groups are part the large media corporations that have their own agenda and it\\'s not your agenda and it\\'s not the country\\'s agenda, it\\'s their own agenda. They have a professional obligation as members of the press to report honestly. But as you saw throughout the entire campaign, and even now, the fake news doesn\\'t tell the truth. Doesn\\'t tell the truth.\\nSo just in finishing, I say it doesn\\'t represent the people, it doesn\\'t tell the never will represent the people, and we\\'re going to do something about it because we have to go out and have to speak our minds and we have to be honest. Our victory was a win like nobody has ever seen before.\\n\\nI\\'m here fighting for you and I will continue to fight for you. The victory and the win were something that really was dedicated to a country and people that believe in freedom, security and the rule of law. Our victory...\\n\\n... was a victory and the win for conservative values.\\n\\nAnd our victory was a win for everyone who believes it\\'s time to stand up for America, to stand up for the American worker and to stand up for the American flag.\\n\\nYeah, there we should stand up. Come on. There we should stand up. OK. And by the way, we love our flag. By the way, you folks are in here -- this place is packed, there are lines that go back six blocks and I tell you that because you won\\'t read about it, OK.\\n\\nBut there are lines that go back six blocks, there is such love in this country for everything we stand for, you saw that on Election Day.\\n\\n And you\\'re going to see it more and more.\\n\\nSo we\\'re all part of this very historic movement, a movement the likes of which, actually, the world has never seen before. There\\'s never been anything like this. There\\'s been some movements, but there\\'s never been anything like this.\\nThere\\'s been some movements that petered out like Bernie, petered out.\\n\\nBut it was a little rigged against him, you know, super delegate, super delegate. She had so many delegates before the thing even started, I actually said to my people, how does that happen? Not that I\\'m a fan of Bernie, but a lot of Bernie people voted for Trump, you know why? Because he\\'s right on one issue; trade. He was right about trade. Our country is being absolutely devastated with bad trade deals. So he was right about that, but we got a lot of Bernie support. So actually, I like Bernie. OK? I like Bernie.\\n\\nBut I\\'m here today to tell you what this movement means for the future of the Republican party and for the future of America. First we need to define what this great, great unprecedented movement is and what it actually represents. The core conviction of our movement is that we are a nation that put and will put its own citizens first.\\n\\n\\n For too long, we\\'ve traded away our jobs to other countries. So terrible. We\\'ve defended other nations\\' borders while leaving ours wide open, anybody can come in. We\\'re going to build a wall, don\\'t worry about it. We\\'re building the wall. We\\'re building the wall. In fact, it\\'s going to start soon. Way ahead of schedule, way ahead of schedule.\\n Way, way, way ahead of schedule. It\\'s going to start very soon. General Kelly by the way has done a fantastic job. Fantastic job he\\'s done.\\n\\nAnd remember, we are getting the bad ones out. These are bad dudes. We\\'re getting the bad ones out, OK? We\\'re getting the bad -- if you watch these people, it\\'s like gee, that\\'s so sad. We\\'re getting bad people out of this country, people that shouldn\\'t be whether it\\'s drugs or murder or other things. We\\'re getting bad ones out, those are the ones that go first and I said it from day one. Basically all I\\'ve done is keep my promise.\\n\\nWe\\'ve spent trillions of dollars overseas, while allowing our own infrastructure to fall into total disrepair and decay. In the Middle East, we\\'ve spent as of four weeks ago, $6 trillion. Think of it.\\n\\nAnd by the way, the Middle East is in -- I mean, it\\'s not even close, it\\'s in much worse shape than it was 15 years ago. If our presidents would have gone to the beach for 15 years, we would be in much better shape than we are right now, that I can tell you.\\n\\nBe a hell of a lot better. We could have rebuilt our country three times with that money. This is the situation that I inherited. I inherited a mess, believe me. We also inherited a failed health care law that threatens our medical system with absolute and total catastrophe. Now, I\\'ve been watching and nobody says it, but Obamacare doesn\\'t work, folks. I mean, I could say, I could talk, it doesn\\'t work.\\nAnd now people are starting to develop a little warm heart, but the people that you\\'re watching, they\\'re not you. They\\'re largely -- many of them are the side that lost, you know they lost the election. It\\'s like, how many elections do we have to have? They lost the election. But I always say, Obamacare doesn\\'t work. And these same people two years ago and a year ago were complaining about Obamacare.\\n And the bottom line, we\\'re changing it. We\\'re going to make it much better, we\\'re going to make it less expensive. We\\'re going to make it much better.\\nObamacare covers very few people -- and remember, deduct from the number all of the people that had great health care that they loved that was taken away from them -- it was taken away from them.\\n\\nMillions of people were very happy with their health care, they had their doctor, they had their plan. Remember the lie, 28 times. You could keep your doctor, you could keep your plan. Over and over and over again, you heard it. So we\\'re going to repeal and replace Obamacare.\\n\\nAnd I tell Paul Ryan and all of the folks that we\\'re working with very hard, Dr. Tom Price, very talented guy.\\n\\nBut I tell them from a purely political standpoint, the single best thing we can do is nothing. Let it implode completely, it\\'s already imploding. You see the carriers are all leaving. I mean, it\\'s a disaster. But two years, don\\'t do anything. The Democrats will come to us and beg for help, they\\'ll beg and it\\'s their problem. But it\\'s not the right thing to do for the American people, it\\'s not the right thing to do.\\n\\nWe inherited a national debt that has doubled in eight years, think of it, $20 trillion, it\\'s doubled. We inherited a foreign policy marked by one disaster after another. We don\\'t win anymore. When was the last time we won? Did we win a war? Did we win anything? Do we win anything? We\\'re going to win. We\\'re going on win big, folks. We\\'re going to start winning again, believe me. We\\'re gonna win.\\n\\n But we\\'re taking a firm, bold and decisive measure, we have to, to turn things around. The era of empty talk is over, it\\'s over. \\nNow is the time for action. So let me tell you about the actions that we\\'re taking right now to deliver on our promise to the American people and on my promise to make America great again. We\\'ve taken swift and strong action to secure the southern border of the United States and to begin the construction of a great, great border wall.\\n\\nBy doing this, and with the help of our great border police, with the help of ICE, with the help of General Kelly and all of the people that are so passionate about this -- our border patrol, I\\'ll tell you what they do, they came and endorsed me, ICE came and endorsed me. They never endorsed a presidential candidate before, they might not even be allowed to.\\n\\nBut they were disgusted with what they saw and we\\'ll stop it. We\\'ll stop the drugs from pouring into our nation and poisoning our youth. Pouring in. Pouring in.\\n\\nWe get the drugs, they get the money. We get the problems, they get the cash. No good. No good. Going to stop. By stopping the flow of illegal immigration, we will save countless tax dollars (ph), and that\\'s so important because the tax -- the dollars we\\'re losing are beyond anything that you can imagine. And the tax dollars that can be used to rebuild struggling American communities, including our inner cities.\\n\\nWe are also going to save countless American lives. As we speak today, immigration offers are finding the gang members, the drug dealers and the criminal aliens and throwing them the hell out of our country.\\n\\n And we will not let them back in. They\\'re not coming back in, folks. They do, they\\'re going to have bigger problems than they ever dreamt of.\\n\\nI\\'m also working with the Department of Justice to being reducing violent crime. I mean, can you believe what\\'s happening in Chicago as an example? Two days ago, seven people were shot and I believe killed. Seven people, seven people, Chicago, a great American city, seven people shot and killed. We will support the incredible men and women of law enforcement.\\n\\nThank you, and thank them. I\\'ve also followed through on my campaigning promise and withdrawn America from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\\n\\nSo that we can protect our economic freedom. And we\\'re going to make trade deals, but we\\'re going to do one on one, one on one, and if they misbehave, we terminate the deal and then they\\'ll come back and we\\'ll make a better deal. None of these big quagmire deals that are a disaster.\\nJust take a look -- by the way, take a look at NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever made by any country, having to do with economic development. It\\'s economy un-development, as far as our country is concerned.\\nWe\\'re preparing to repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. We\\'re going to save Americans from this crisis, and give them the access to the quality health care they need and deserve. We have authorized the construction, one day, of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines.\\n\\nAnd issued a new rule -- this took place while I was getting ready to sign. I said who makes the pipes for the pipeline? Well sir, it comes from all over the world, isn\\'t that wonderful? I said nope, comes from the United States, or we\\'re not building it. \\nAmerican steel.\\n\\nIf they want a pipeline in the United States, they\\'re going to use pipe that\\'s made in the United States. Do we agree?\\n\\nBut can you imagine -- I told this story the other day -- can you imagine the gentleman -- never met him, don\\'t even know the name of this company. I actually sort of know it, but I want to get it exactly correct. Big, big powerful company, they spend hundreds of millions of dollars on the pipeline, same thing with the Dakota, different vice. They got their approvals, everything, in the case of Dakota, then all of a sudden they couldn\\'t connect it because they had people protesting that never showed up before.\\nBut with the Keystone -- so they spent hundreds of millions of dollars with bloodsucker consultants -- you know, sucking the blood out of the company, don\\'t worry, I\\'ve used them all my life, OK? Don\\'t worry, we\\'re going to get it approved, I\\'m connected, I\\'m a lobbyist, don\\'t worry. Bottom line, Obama didn\\'t sign it, right? Could be 42,000 jobs, somewhere around there -- a lot of jobs. Didn\\'t sign it.\\nBut can you imagine, he gave up. A year ago, it was dead, now he\\'s doing anything, calling his wife, hello darling, I\\'m a little bored, you know that pipeline that has killed us, that has killed our company. Knock, knock. Mr. so and so, the Keystone Pipeline sir, out of nowhere has just been approved.\\n\\nNow, can you imagine the expression? And you know the sad part? Those same blood sucking consultants that hit them for all the money and failed, they\\'re now going to go back to him and say, did we do a great job; we want more money, right? Because that\\'s the way the system works, a little bit off, but that\\'s the way the system works.\\nWe\\'re preparing bold action to lift the restrictions on American energy, including shale oil, natural gas and beautiful clean coal and we\\'re going to put our miners back to work.\\n\\n Miners are going back to work, folks. Sorry to tell you that, but they\\'re going back to work.\\nWe have begun a historic program to reduce the regulations that are crushing our economy, crushing.\\n\\nAnd not only our economy, crushing our jobs because companies can\\'t hire. We\\'re going to put the regulation industry out of work and out of business.\\n\\nAnd by the way, I want regulation. I want to protect our environment, I want regulations for safety, I want all of the regulations that we need and I want them to be so strong and so tough, but we don\\'t need 75 percent of the repetitive, horrible regulations that hurt companies, hurt jobs, make us non-competitive overseas with other companies from other countries, that we don\\'t need.\\nBut we\\'re going to have regulation. It\\'s going to be really strong and really good and we\\'re going to protect our environment and we\\'re going to protect the safety of our people and our workers, OK?\\n\\nAnother major promise is tax reform. We\\'re going to massively lower taxes on the middle class, reduce taxes on American business and make our tax code more simple and much more fair for everyone, including the people and the business.\\n\\nIn anticipation of these and other changes, jobs are already starting to pour back into our country, you see that. In fact, I think I did more than any other pre-president, they say president- elect. President-elect is meeting with Ford, he\\'s meeting with Chrysler, he\\'s meeting with General Motors. I just wanted to save a little time.\\n\\nBecause Ford and Fiat Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Intel, and so many others are now, because of the election result, making major investments in the United States, expanding production and hiring more workers. And they\\'re going back to Michigan and they\\'re going back to Ohio and they\\'re going back to Pennsylvania and they\\'re going back to North Carolina and to Florida.\\n\\nIt\\'s time for all Americans to get off of welfare and get back to work, you\\'re going to love it, you\\'re going to love it, you\\'re going to love it.\\n\\nWe\\'re also put nothing a massive budget request for our beloved military.\\n\\nAnd we will be substantially upgrading all of our military, all of our military, offensive, defensive, everything, bigger and better and stronger than ever before. And hopefully, we\\'ll never have to use it, but nobody\\'s gonna mess with us, folks, nobody.\\n\\nIt will be one of the greatest military build-ups in American history. No one will dare question as they have been because we\\'re very depleted, very, very depleted. Sequester. Sequester. Nobody will dare question our military might again. We believe in peace through strength and that\\'s what we will have.\\n\\nAs part of my pledge to restore safety for the American people, I have also directed the defense community to develop a plan to totally obliterate ISIS.\\n\\n Working with our allies, we will eradicate this evil from the face of the Earth.\\n\\nAt the same time, we fully understand that national security begins with border security; foreign terrorists will not be able to strike America if they cannot get into our country.\\n\\nBy the way, take a look at what\\'s happening in Europe, folks, take a look at what\\'s happening in Europe. I took a lot of heat on Sweden.\\n\\nAnd then a day later, I said has anybody reported what\\'s going on? And it turned out that they didn\\'t -- not too many of them did. Take a look at what happened in Sweden. I love Sweden, great country, great people, I love Sweden. But they understand. The people over there understand I\\'m right. Take a look at what\\'s happening in Sweden. Take a look at what\\'s happening in Germany. Take a look at what\\'s happened in France. Take a look at Nice and Paris.\\nI have a friend, he\\'s a very, very substantial guy. He loves the city of lights, he loves Paris. For years, every year during the summer, he would go to Paris, was automatic with his wife and his family. Hadn\\'t seen him in a while. And I said, Jim, let me ask you a question, how\\'s Paris doing? \"Paris? I don\\'t go there anymore, Paris is no longer Paris.\" That was four years -- four or five years hasn\\'t gone there. He wouldn\\'t miss it for anything. Now he doesn\\'t even think in terms of going there.\\nTake a look at what\\'s happening to our world, folks. And we have to be smart. We have to be smart. We can\\'t let it happen to us.\\n\\nSo let me state this as clearly as I can, we are going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country.\\n We will not be deterred from this course, and in a matter of days, we will be taking brand-new action to protect our people and keep America safe, you will see the action. I will never ever apologize for protecting the safety and security of the American people, I won\\'t do it.\\n\\nIf it means I get bad press, if it means people speak badly of me, it\\'s OK, doesn\\'t bother me. The security of our people is number one, is number one.\\n\\nOur administration is running with great efficiency, even though I still don\\'t have my Cabinet approved, nobody mentions that.\\n\\nYou know, I still have people out there waiting to be approved and everyone knows they\\'re gonna be approved. It\\'s just a delay, delay, delay, it\\'s really sad, it\\'s really sad. And these are great people, these are some great people. We still don\\'t have our Cabinet. I assume we\\'re setting records for that. That\\'s the only thing good about it is we\\'re setting records. I love setting records.\\n\\nBut I hate having a Cabinet meeting and I see all these empty seats. I said, Democrats, please approve our Cabinet and get smart on health care, too, if you don\\'t mind.\\n\\n\\nBut we\\'re taking meetings everyday with top leaders in business, in science and industry. Yesterday, I had 29 of the biggest business leaders in the world in my office; Caterpillar, Tractor (ph), Campbell\\'s Soup. We had everybody. We had everybody. I like Campbell\\'s Soup.\\n\\n\\nWe had everybody and we came to a lot of very good conclusions and a lot of those folks that are in that room are gonna be building big, big, massive new plants and lots of jobs. And you know what? They\\'re gonna be building them in this country, not in some other country.\\n\\nWe\\'re meeting with unions, meeting with law enforcement and we\\'re meeting with leaders from all around where the White House doors used to be totally closed. They were closed, folks. You don\\'t realize that, they were closed.\\n They\\'re now wide open and they\\'re open for people doing business for our country and putting people to work.\\n\\nAnd when they come into the White House, we\\'re translating these meetings into action. One by one, we\\'re checking off the promises we made to the people of the United States. One by one, a lot of promises. And we will not stop until the job is done. We will reduce your taxes, we will cut your regulations, we will support our police, we will defend our flag.\\n\\nWe will rebuild our military. We will take care of our great, great veterans. We\\'re taking care of our veterans.\\n\\nWe will fix our broken and embarrassing trade deals that are no good. None of them. You wonder where did the people come from that negotiated these deals. Where did they come from? Well, they came also from campaign contributions, I must be honest. They\\'re not as stupid as you think.\\n\\nWe will cut wasteful spending. We will promote our values. We will rebuild our inner cities. We will bring back our jobs and our dreams. So true. So true.\\n\\nAnd by the way, we will protect our Second Amendment.\\n\\nYou know, Wayne and Chris are here from the NRA and they didn\\'t have that on the list. It\\'s lucky I thought about it.\\n\\nBut we will indeed, and they\\'re great people. And by the way, they love our country. They love our country. The NRA has been a great supporter. They love our country.\\n\\nThe forgotten men and women of America will be forgotten no longer. That is the heart of this new movement and the future of the Republican Party. People came to vote, and these people, the media, they said where are they coming from? What\\'s going on here? These are hard-working, great, great Americans. These are unbelievable people who have not been treated fairly. Hillary called them deplorable. They\\'re not deplorable.\\n\\nAUDIENCE: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!\\n Who would have thought that a word was gonna play (ph) so badly?\\n\\nThat\\'s the problem in politics. One wrong word and it\\'s over. She also said irredeemable, but we won\\'t mention that.\\n\\nThe GOP will be, from now on, the party also of the American worker.\\n\\nYou know, we haven\\'t been as a group given credit for this, but if you look at how much bigger our party has gotten during this cycle, during the early days when we had 17 people running in the primaries. Millions and millions of people were joining. Now, I won\\'t say it was because of me, but it was. OK?\\n\\n\\nAnd we have an amazing, strong, powerful party that truly does want to see America be great again, and it will see it and it\\'s gonna see it a lot sooner than you think, believe me, a lot sooner than you think.\\n\\n We will not answer to donors or lobbyists, or special interests, but we will serve the citizens of the United States of America, believe me.\\n\\nGlobal cooperation, dealing with other countries, getting along with other countries is good, it\\'s very important.

America, it\\'s the allegiance to America.\\n\\nNo matter our background or income, or geography, we\\'re all citizens of this blessed land.

So I want to thank you folks, that was amazing -- an amazing outpour...\\n\\n... and I will not disappoint you. As long as we have faith in each other and trust in God, then there is no goal at all beyond our reach. There is no dream too large, no task too great, we are Americans and the future belongs to us.\\n\\nThe future belongs to all of you. And America is coming about, and it\\'s coming back, and it\\'s roaring and you can hear it. It\\'s going to be bigger and better. It is going to be -- it is going to be -- remember and it\\'s roaring. It\\'s going to be bigger and better and stronger than ever before.\\n\\nI want to thank you.\\nAnd Matt and Mercedes, I want to thank the two of you, and all of the supporters that I have.\\nI see them; they\\'re all over the place. You are really great people. I want to thank you.\\n\\nAnd I want to say to you, God bless you and God bless the United States of America. Thank you, folks. Thank you.\\n'), ('Trump Response to Healthcare Bill Failure.txt', \" Thank you very much. We were very close, and it was a very, very tight margin. We had no Democrat support. We had no votes from the Democrats. They weren't going to give us a single vote, so it's a very difficult thing to do.\\nI've been saying for the last year and a half that the best thing we can do politically speaking is let Obamacare explode. It is exploding right now. It's -- many states have big problems, almost all states have big problems. I was in Tennessee the other day and they've lost half of their state in terms of an insurer. They have no insurer. And that's happening to many other places. I was in Kentucky the other day and similar things are happening.\\nSo, Obamacare is exploding. With no Democrat support we couldn't quite get there. We were just a very small number of votes short in terms of getting our bill passed. A lot of people don't realize how good our bill was because they were viewing phase one. But when you add phase two, which was mostly the signings of Secretary Price, who is behind me, and you add phase three, which I think we would have gotten, it became a great bill. Premiums would have gone down and it would have been very stable. It would have been very strong. But that's okay. But we're very, very close and, again, I think what will happen is Obamacare, unfortunately, will explode. It's going to have a very bad year. Last year you had over 100 percent increases in various places.\\nIn Arizona I understand it's going up very rapidly again, like it did last year. Last year was 116 percent. Many places 50, 60, 70 percent. I guess it averaged whatever the average was, very, very high. And this year should be much worse for Obamacare.\\nSo, what would be really good with no Democrat support, if the Democrats when it explodes, which it will soon, if they got together with us and got a real health care bill, I'd be totally open to it, and I think that's going to happen. I think the losers are Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, because now they own Obamacare. They own it, 100 percent own it. And this is not a Republican health care. This is not anything but a Democrat health care.\\nAnd they have Obamacare for a little while longer, until it ceases to exist, which it will at some point in the near future. And just remember this is not our bill, this is their bill.\\nNow, when they all become civilized and get together and try and workout a great health care bill for the people of this country, we're open to it, we're totally open to it. I want to thank the Republican Party.\\nI want to thank Paul Ryan. He worked very, very hard, I will tell you that. He worked very, very hard.\\nTom Price and Mike Pence, who is right here, our vice president, our great vice president. Everybody worked hard. I worked as a team player, and would have loved to have seen it pass. But, again, I think you know I was very clear because I think there wasn't a speech I made, or very few where I didn't mention that perhaps the best thing that could happen is exactly what happened today, because we'll end up with a truly great health care bill in the future after this mess known as Obamacare explodes.\\nSo, I want to thank everybody for being here. It will go very smoothly. I really believe. I think this is something -- it certainly was an interesting period of time. We all learned a lot. We learned a lot about royalty. We learned a lot about the vote- getting process. We learned a lot about some very arcane rules in obviously both the Senate and in the House.\\nSo, it's been certainly, for me, it's been a very interesting experience. But in the end I think it's going to be an experience that leads to an even better health care plan. So, thank you all very much and I'll see you soon. Thank you.\\n\\n We'll probably be going right now for tax reform, which we could have done earlier, but this really would have worked out better if we could have had some Democrat support. Remember, this, we had no Democrat support. So, now we're going to go for tax reform which I've always liked.\\nQUESTION: And you're confident in Speaker Ryan's leadership and his ability to get things done?\\n Yes, am. I like Speaker Ryan. he worked very, very hard. A lot of different groups, he's got a lot of factions, and there's been a long history of liking and disliking, even within the Republican Party, long before I got here.\\nBut I've had a great relationship with the Republican Party. It seems that both sides like Trump, and that's good, and you see that, I guess, more clearly than anybody. But we've had -- I'm not going to speak badly about anybody within the party, but certainly there is a big history.\\nI think Paul really worked hard, and I would say that we will probably start going very, very strongly for the big tax cuts and tax reform. That will be next.\\n\\n Well, it's going to happen. There's not much you can do about it. It's going to -- bad things are going to happen to Obamacare. There's not much you can do to help it. I've been saying that for a year and a half. I said, look, eventually it's not sustainable. The insurance companies are leaving. You know that. They're leaving one by one as quick as you can leave. And you have states in some cases soon will not be covered. So, there's no way out of that.\\nBut the one thing that was happening as we got closer and closer, everybody was talking about how wonderful it was, and now it will go back to real life. People will see how bad it is, and it's getting much worse.\\nYou know, I said the other day when president Obama left, '17, he knew he wasn't going to be here. '17 is going to be a very, very bad year for Obamacare, very, very bad. You're going to have explosive premium increases, and your deductibles are so high people don't even get to use it.\\nSo they'll go with that for a little while. And I honestly believe -- I know some Democrats, and they're good people. I honestly believe the Democrats will come to us and say, look, let's get together and get a great health care bill or plan that's really great for the people of our country. And I think that's going to happen.\\n Well, we were very close. We were just probably anywhere from 10 to 15 votes short. Could have even been closer than that. You'll never know because you never know how though vote. But in the end I think we would have been 10 votes, maybe closer.\\nAnd -- but it's very hard to get almost 100 percent. You know, you're talking about a very, very large number of votes, among any group. And we were very close to doing it. But when you get no votes from the other side, meaning the Democrats, it's really a difficult situation.\\n No, I think we have to let Obamacare go its way for a little while. And we'll see how things go. I would love to see it do well, but it can't. I mean, it can't. I mean, it's not a question of, gee, I hope it does well, I would love it to do well. I want great health care for the people of this nation. But it can't do well.\\nIt's imploding and soon will explode and it's not going to be pretty. So, the Democrats don't want to see that. So, they're going to reach out when they're ready. And whenever they're ready, we're ready.\\n\\n No, not particularly. They're friends of mine. I'm disappointed because we could have had it. So I'm disappointed. I'm a little surprised, to be honest with you. We really had it. It was pretty much there within grasp.\\nBut I'll tell you what's going to come out of it is a better bill. I really believe a better bill, because there were things in this bill I didn't particularly like. And I think it's a better bill. You know, both parties can get together and do real health care, that's the best thing. Obamacare was rammed down everyone's throat, 100 percent Democrat. And I think having bipartisan would be a big, big improvement. So, no, I think that this is going to end up being a very good thing.\\nI'm disappointed, but they're friends of mine. And, you know, they got on -- it was a very hard time for them and a very hard vote. But they're very good people.\\n\\n Well, I think we could have had things that I would have liked more. And if we had bipartisan I really think we could have a health care bill that would be the ultimate. And I think the Democrats know that also.\\nAnd some day in the not too distant future that will happen. And I never said -- I guess I'm here, what, 64 days? I never said repeal and replace Obamacare. You've all heard my speeches. I never said repeal it and replace it within 64 days. I have a long time.\\nBut I want to have a great health care bill and plan, and we will. It will happen. And it won't be in the very distant future. I really believe there will be some Democrat support and that will happen, and it will be an even better bill.\\nI think this was a very good bill. I think it will be even better the next time around. And I don't think that's going to be in too long a period of time.\\n\\n No, I mean, I don't want to speak about specifics, but there are things I could have -- I would have liked even more. But I thought overall this was a very, very good bill.\\nAnd I thought Tom Price -- Dr. Tom Price, who really is amazing on health care and his knowledge, I thought he did a fantastic job. Same with Mike Pence. I think these two guys, they worked so hard and really did a fantastic job.\\nThank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.

I want to be in a room filled with hard working American patriots who love their country, who salute their flag and who pray for a better future.\\n\\nI also want to speak to you without the filter of the fake news. The dishonest media which has published one false story after another with no sources, even though they pretend they have them, they make them up in many cases, they just don't want to report the truth and they've been calling us wrong now for two years. They don't get it. By they're starting to get it. I can tell you that. They've become a big part of the problem. They are part of the corrupt system. Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, and Abraham Lincoln and many of our greatest presidents fought with the media and called them out often times on their lies. When the media lies to people, I will never, ever let them get away with it. I will do whatever I can that. They don't get away with it.\\n\\nThey have their own agenda and their agenda is not your agenda. In fact, Thomas Jefferson said, “nothing can be believed which is seen in a newspaper.” “Truth itself,” he said, “becomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle,” that was June 14, my birthday, 1807. But despite all their lies, misrepresentations, and false stories, they could not defeat us in the primaries, and they could not defeat us in the general election, and we will continue to expose them for what they are, and most importantly, we will continue to win, win, win.\\n\\nWe are not going to let the fake news tell us what to do, how to live, or what to believe. We are free and independent people and we will make our own choices.\\n\\nWe are here today to speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I hear your demands, I hear your voices and I promise you I will deliver. I promise that. And by the way, you've seen what we've accomplished in a very short period of time. The White House is running so smoothly. So smoothly. And believe me, I and we inherited one big mess. That I can tell you, but I know that you want safe neighborhoods where the streets belong to families and communities, not gang members and drug dealers who are right now as I speak being thrown out of the country and they will not be let back in.\\n\\nWe will have strong borders again, and I mean that. You've seen it in television. You've seen it on television. General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, he's really doing the job. You're seeing it. The gang members, bad, bad people. I said day one, and they're going out. Or they're being put in prison, but for the most part, get them the hell out of here. Bring them back to where they came from.\\n\\nThe fact is, you want great schools for your children. You want good high paying jobs for yourselves and for your loved ones and for the future of your families. You want a health care system and by the way, we are going to be submitting in a couple of weeks a great healthcare plan that's going to take the place of the disaster known as Obamacare.\\n\\nIt will be repealed and replaced. For those people. The people put into rooms where Republicans are talking about the plan, and it wouldn't matter what they say, for those people just so you understand, our plan will be much better health care at a much lower coast. Okay? Nothing to complain about. Obamacare remember, it is a disaster.\\n\\nYou want low cost American energy also, which means lifting the restrictions on oil, on shell, on natural gas and on clean, very clean coal. We're going to put the miners back to work. The miners go back to work.\\n\\nYou want us to enforce immigration laws and defend our borders.\\n\\nYou want fair trade deals and a level playing field. We don't have a level playing field. Because you understand that when American workers win, America as a country wins and wins big. And every country over the last long period of time has been taking advantage of the [inaudible] of our politicians. It's not going to happen any longer.\\n\\nYou want lower taxes. Less regulation. Millions of new jobs and more product stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words, “Made in the USA.” You want to make it easy for companies to do business in America. And harder for companies to leave. We don't want companies saying, everybody is fired. We're moving to another country. We're going to make the product. Sell it across the border and isn't that wonderful. Not going happen anymore.\\n\\nWe're going to have strong borders and when they want to sell that product back across our border, they're going to pay a 35% tax and you know what, they're never going to leave. They will never, ever leave.\\n\\nAnd you've seen that because I've already displayed it for the last two months even before I got into office. They're not leaving. And if they do, they're going to pay a big price for terminating the relationship with our workers. You want a government that serves the people not the donors and special interest. You want a government that keeps its promises.\\n\\nA great spirit of optimism is sweeping and you see it. it's sweeping all across the country. Look at what's happening to the stock market. Look at what's happening to the every poll when it comes to optimism in our country. It's sweeping across the country.

You're going to be proud again.\\n\\nJobs are already starting to pour back in. They're coming back in like you haven't seen in a long time. Ford, General Motors, Fiat, Chrysler are bringing in and bringing back thousands of jobs investing billions of dollars because of the new business climate that we are creating in our country. In Arizona, Intel, great company, just announced it will open a new plant that will create at least 10,000 brand new beautiful American jobs.\\n\\nI followed through on my promise to withdraw from the job killing disaster known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. TPP, we have just terminated our relationship to it. We're going to have tremendous trade deals all over the world, but they're going to be bilateral or as we would say, one-on-one. None of these deals where we get caught in quicksand. Get mired in and we can't do anything about it. By the way, NAFTA and so many others.\\n\\nMy administration has begun plans to crack down on foreign cheating and currency manipulation which is killing our companies and really, really hurting our workers. We're going to end it.\\n\\nWithin a few days of taking the oath of office, I've taken steps to begin the construction of the Keystone and the Dakota Access Pipelines. Anywhere from 30-40,000 jobs. And very importantly, as I was about to sign it, I said who makes the pipe? Who makes the pipe? Something this audience understands very well, right? Simple question. The lawyers put this very complex document in front. I said, who makes the pipe? They said, sir, it can be made anywhere. I said not anymore. I put a little clause in the bottom. The pipe has to be made in the United States of America if we're going to have pine line.\\n\\nWe believe in two simple rules. I can tell you everybody in this massive, this is a massive hanger. For the big planes. And by the way, do you think that one media group back there, one network will show this crowd. Not one. Not one. They won't show the crowd. You know, coming in on the plane, and that plane represented so much.\\n\\nAnd just so you know, they were close to signing a $4.2 billion deal to have a new Air Force One. Can you believe this? I said no way. I said I refuse to fly in a $4.2 billion airplane. I refuse. So I got Boeing and it is actually — a lot of people don't know. The Air Force One project is actually two planes. Why they need to planes, we'll have to talk about that, but they have two planes, but we've got that price down over a billion dollars and I probably have it spoken to be honest with you for honest probably an more than an hour on the project. I got the generals in who are fantastic. I got Boeing in. I told Boeing it's not good enough. We're still not going to do it. The price is still too high. On the fighter jet. We were hundreds of billions of dollars over budget. Seven years late, great plane. A great plane.\\n\\nSo think of it. They're seven years late. Hundreds of billions of dollars over-budget. Other than that by the way the project is going extremely well. And I got the folks in from Lockheed Martin who are terrific people and a terrific product by the way. I also got Boeing in. I said do me a favor, give me a competing offer. And now they're competing and fighting and we've gotten hundreds of millions of dollars off the price of a plane that was going to be ordered, in other words, if my opponent got in, there would have been no calls made to them. They would have signed contracts. So they're going to make plenty of money, but it's going to be a lot less than they would have made without Trump. That I can tell you. You might as well know about it. Nobody talks. By the way, that's for fighter jets. One of the biggest orders in the history of aviation. The order for the F-35. You've been reading about it because it was a disaster. Under the last administration. A disaster. And now we have it running beautifully.\\n\\nIn fact, when the Prime Minister of Japan, Prime Minister Abe, was great. Great guy. When he came over, he said, thank you. I said for what. You saved us many, many millions of dollars on the F-35 fighter jet. Because when I negotiated, I took our allies into the same negotiation. So the first thing he did was thanked med for saving them money and that's good. Okay. That's good. I know the media will never thank me so at least Japan is thanking me, right?\\n\\nBut we believe in two simple rules. Buy American and hire American. We believe it. We've just issued a new order which requires that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. And by the way, a new director was just approved. Can you imagine the length of time it's taken to Democrats and I actually think it's an embarrassment to them, but this is getting in to be record setting time. Incredible people.\\n\\nScott Pruitt was just approved, just now approved for the Environmental Protection Agency. He'll do so good. He won't have projects going ten and 12 years and getting rejected. They may be rejected, but they'll be rejected quickly. For the most part, they're going to be accepted. They're going to be environmentally friendly and he is going to be a great Secretary. He will be amazing. We're very happy. That took place yesterday. That's going to be a big difference because they were clogging up the veins of our country with the environmental impact statements and all of the rules and regulations. It was impossible to navigate for companies.\\n\\nAnd what did it really mean? Forget about the companies? What did it mean. It meant no jobs. It meant companies leaving our country and going to foreign countries to do things they would rather do here. So we're going to have a whole big situation. We are going to unfreeze all of those companies. They are going to be — they're going have freedom. Be able to build what they want to build. It will be environmentally friendly and we're going to start producing jobs like you've never seen before. That's going to happen. That was a big thing.\\n\\nWe're standing up for the incredible men and women always of law enforcement. We're standing up. And I can tell you, the military and law enforcement they stood up. I don't say for me. I'm the messenger folks. I'm the messenger. They stood up for us in this last election. We got numbers that nobody believed were possible from law enforcement and from military. Basically people they wear uniforms like us. Isn't that nice. I saw this man on TV just now, you. I just saw him on television. He said I love Trump. Let Trump do what he has to do. That's my guy right there. Come here. Come here. No, I just. I'm coming in. That's okay.\\n\\nLet him up. I'm not worried about him. I'm only worried he's going to give me a kiss. I'm not worried about anything else. This guy is so great. He was one of many people. They're interviewing people in the line. And I have to say, there was a tiny group of protesters out there and they were given as much publicity as this massive room packed with people, but they interviewed this man. Come on up here. Come on up. Guy was great. Hop over the fence. Come on. He can do it. He's in good shape. Look at him. Look at this guy. Come on. This guy is great. Don't worry about him. No, no. Come here. They're going to — come on up. Come here.\\n\\nThis guy. So he's been all over television saying the best things and I see him standing and didn't you get here at like 4 in the morning.\\n\\n\\nSay a couple of words to this crowd.\\n\\n\\nA star is born.\\n\\n\\nI wouldn't say that Secret Service was thrilled with that, but we know our people, right? We know our people. Great guy. And so many others. I see some others. Being interviewed. I see them over here. They started. They came at 4 in the morning. The media will give them no credit. The media, as I told you, won't show this crowd.\\n\\nAll the way outside of this — this is a big a hanger as you get. All the way outside. Way back to the fences. Amazing. I want to thank you, but I want to thank everybody.\\n\\nI've directed the Department of Justice to take a firm, firm stance to protect our cops, sheriffs, and police from crimes of violence against them. We will work with our police not against our police, our police do a great job and they've never been troubled like they're troubled now. It's very unfair what's happening. So we want to cherish our law enforcement. We will always protect those who protect us.\\n\\nWe've directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including our inner cities. We're going to make our inner cities safe again. Look at what's going on. Look at what's happening in Chicago. Hundreds of shootings, hundreds of deaths. I'll tell you what's happening in Chicago and many other places. Safety is a civil right. And we will fight to make America totally safe again.\\n\\nI've ordered the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy transnational criminal cartels which are all over the United States and we are going to stop the drugs from pours into your country, into your community, into your cities and poisoning our youth. We're stopping it. We're stopping it. We've taken historic action to secure the southern border and I've ordered the construction of a great border wall, which will start very shortly.\\n\\nAnd I've taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorist the hell out of our country. So you probably read where we want to enforce the laws as existing. And so we signed an order a couple of weeks ago, and it was taken over by a court originally by a judge and then a — yes, it's very sad. The reason is for protection and safety. So the statute is so plain and so clear.\\n\\nI said last week, I was speaking to a great group of sheriffs, the sheriffs group in Washington, and I said if you have a college education, you can understand its. If you have a high school education, you can understand it. If you were a bad student in high school, you can understand it.\\n\\nI was told. I'll check, but I found it hard to believe, over 30-page decision by the appellate court. Three judges. And you could tell by the way they were reacting because it was broadcast on television. Everything we do gets a lot of people watching. So you could tell by the way that phone call went, wasn't looking good. When they wrote their decision, as I understand it. Maybe I'm wrong.\\n\\nThey didn't write the statute they were making the decision about because every word of the statute is a total kill for the other side. So I thought I would read it. And here's what it says. This is what it says: “Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or any class of aliens into the United States” — okay. So essentially. Whenever somebody comes into the United States. Right.\\n\\n“If it would be detrimental to the interest of the United States” — okay. Now you know the country's we're talking about and these were countries picked by Obama. They weren't even picked. They were picked by Obama.\\n\\n“He may,” so the President may, “by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary” — now, because it should have said he or she, right. They were not politically correct when they drew this. In fact, that's the only thing that was actually wrong with it. He or she. I don't think the women care too much about that. Right? I don't think so. By the way, we did very well with women. You know, my wife said when some of these phony polls were put out, the CNN poll was so far off, the phony polls. When some of these, she said, what's wrong with you and women. We did very nicely with women. We did nicely with a lot of groups they didn't think we were going to do so nicely with. I guess we had to. That's why we're all here tonight. Right?\\n\\nSo and it goes, “for such as he shall seem necessary suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants or impose on aliens any restriction he may deem to be appropriate.” So basically it says the president has the right to keep people out if he feels it's not in the best interest of our country. Right? Unbelievable. Unbelievable. And I listened to these judges talk and talk and talk. So unfair. So we'll be doing something over the next couple of days. We don't give up. We never give up.\\n\\nWe had a court that I disagree with. I disagree with big league — and by the way, whether you read it or whether you watch it on television when other lawyers come on, many of them can't even understand. They're saying how do you come up with that decision. It cannot be more simple. So they're ruling on what I just read you and they don't even quote it in their ruling because you can't because it's too obvious. So we will do something next week. I think you'll be impressed. Let's see what happens.\\n\\nHere's the bottom line. We've got to keep our country safe. You look at what's happening. We've got to keep our country safe. You look at what's happening in Germany, you look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbers. They're having problems like they never thought possible. You look at what's happening in Brussels. You look at what's happening all over the world. Take a look at Nice. Take a look at Paris. We've allowed thousands and thousands of people into our country and there was no way to vet those people. There was no documentation. There was no nothing. So we're going to keep our country safe.\\n\\nAnd we all have heart, by the way. And what I want to do is build safe zones in Syria and other places so they can stay there and live safely until their cities and their country, that mess that I was left by Obama and everybody else — folks, we were left a mess like you wouldn't believe, but we're going to build safe zones. We're going to have those safe zones.\\n\\nWe do owe $20 trillion. Okay. So we're going to have the gulf states pay for those safe zones. They've got nothing, but money. We're going to do it that way instead of taking massive numbers. Tens the of thousands of people into our country and we don't know anything about those people. We want people to come into our country, but we want people that love us. We want people that can cherish us and the traditions of our country. We want people that are going to be great for our country. We don't want people with bad, bad ideas. We don't want that.\\n\\nI've also directed the defense community headed by General, now — you know, he said it, he said it — and now Secretary ‘Mad Dog’ Mattis, to develop a plan to totally destroy ISIS. I have ordered the department of defense to begin plans for the great rebuilding of the united states military. We will pursue peace through strength. Our military is badly depleted. You have planes in the military. Where the father flew them and now the son is flying them. Their so old. We make the best equipment anywhere in the world. We're going to start using our best and most modern equipment.\\n\\nAnd we're going to make sure our veterans have the care they need when they come home. We love our veterans. We're going to do a great job for our veterans. Our veterans have been very, very sadly treated. These are our great great people. We owe them so much. Our veterans are going to be taken care of for once and for all. Our system and our country has led down our veterans. We are not going to let that go on any further. You wait and you see what we're going to be doing for our great veterans. Thank you veterans. Who is here? Who is a veteran? We're going to take care of our veterans.\\n\\nWe're going to downsize the bloated, bloated bureaucracy which make the government lien and accountable. We're going to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C. I've already imposed a five year lobbying ban on the executive branch officials and lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government.\\n\\nAnd there's another major promise I have kept to the American people. I've nominated a fantastic justice to replace the late great Justice Scalia. His name is Judge Neil Gorsuch. He comes from my list of 20 very, very highly qualified judges. He's incredible and has an incredible resume. He's respected by all. His education is as good as it can get. His writings are truly amazing. He will be a true, true defender of our constitution. So let's tell the Senate Democrats to support his nomination for the good of the country because what's happening with the Democrats — no wonder they're doing so badly.\\n\\nNo wonder they're doing so badly. You take a look, race after race, I just want the tell you, in case you didn't read it, of course you're reading the fake news, but the Democrats were supposed to win the presidency. That didn't happen. They were supposed to take over the Senate. That didn't happen. And they were supposed to take over potentially even the House. It was going to be four weeks out the greatest defeat in the modern history of American politics. And it was, but it was for the Democrats, not for the Republicans. So we have to tell the Democrats, because they're doing the wrong thing for the American people, to stop their tactics of delay and obstruction and destruction. They got to get on with it.\\n\\nMy administration is also pushing ahead strongly with very historic tax reform. We are working to lower tax rates in the middle class to reduce tax rates big league on businesses and to make our tax code more fair and very simple for all Americans so it's understandable by everyone. Senate Democrats should work with us to lower taxes and bring back our jobs, but the Democrats want to increase your taxes very, very substantially. We're not going let that happen.\\n\\nAlso time for the Senate Democrats to take responsibility for Obamacare and to work with us to replace it with new reforms that reverse this nation-wide healthcare tragedy. It's a tragedy. You look at some states, Arizona, up 116%. Your deductibles have gone so high you can never use it. Obamacare doesn't work. It's become totally unaffordable. Remember they said the healthcare, it's unaffordable. It doesn't work. And I said to the Republicans, I said you want to do something great politically: don't do anything. Sit back for two years, let it explode. The Democrats will come and beg for us to do something, but we can't do that to the American people. We have to fix it. And we will.\\n\\nWe need members of both parties to join hands and work with us to pass a $1 trillion infrastructure plan to build new roads and bridges and airports and tunnels and highways and railways all across our great nation.\\n\\nYou're all part of this incredible movement. This movement that we talk about so much. That's been written about on the cover of every magazine all over the world. It's a movement that is just sweeping. It's sweeping across our country. It's sweeping frankly across the globe. Look at Brexit. Look at Brexit. Much smaller example, but it's still something you can look at. People want to take back control of their countries and they want to take back control of their lives and the lives of their family.\\n\\nThe nation state remains the best model for human happiness and the American nation remains the greatest symbol of liberty, of freedom and justice on the face of god's earth. And now we have spirit like we've never had before. It's now that we have our sacred duty and we have no choice and we want this choice to defend our country, to protect its values and to serve its great, great citizens. Erasing national borders does not make people safer. It undermines democracy and trade prosperity. We're giving it away.\\n\\nThe so-called global elite have done well for themselves, but left working families with shrinking wages. Really they are shrinking. 18 years ago though many of you in this room made more money working one job than you're making right now working two and three jobs. Instead of peace, we've seen wars that never end and conflicts that never seem to go away. We don't fight to win. We fight politically correct wars. We don't win anymore. We don't win at trade. We don't win in any capacity. We don't win anymore. We're going to start winning again. Believe me.\\n\\nAnd we have the chance now working together to deliver change for the ages. This will be change for the ages. Change like never before. To pursue real peace, real stability, and real prosperity. We want to secure our borders and protect our workers. To rebuild our military and our infrastructure. To fix our schools and restore safety to our neighborhoods. To bring hope and opportunity to our inner cities. To ensure a level playing field for all women in the workforce. To reform our tax code and remove the regulations that undermine growth and innovation. And to replace chaos and distrust with community and cooperation. The tired echoes of yesterday's fights. We're fighting battles that no longer help us. We're fighting battles that other people aren't treating us fairly in the fight.\\n\\nI'm a NATO fan, but many of the countries in NATO, many of the countries that we protect, many of these countries are very rich countries. They're not paying their bills. They're not paying their bills. They have to help us. No longer are we chained down by the discredited approaches of the past. No longer must we listen to those who have nothing to brag about, but failure. New circumstances demand new solutions. Americans have fought and won wars together. Our heroes have shed their blood together and lost their lives. Our citizens have raised their children together, fought for justice together, and shared common hopes and dreams from one generation to the next. Stretching back to the first day of our American independence. This is our legacy. It belongs to all of you. And it belongs to every man, woman, and child in our nation.\\n\\nNow is the time to call upon these deep ties in the name of bold acts. Let us move past the differences party and find a new loyalty rooted deeply in our country. We are all brothers and all sisters. We share one home. One destiny and one glorious American flag. We are united together by history and by providence. We will make America strong again. I promise. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Greater than ever before.\\n\\nMay God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.\"), ('Trump Black History Month Speech.txt', 'Well, the election, it came out really well. Next time we’ll triple the number or quadruple it. We want to get it over 51, right? At least 51.\\n\\nWell this is Black History Month, so this is our little breakfast, our little get-together. Hi Lynn, how are you? Just a few notes. During this month, we honor the tremendous history of African-Americans throughout our country. Throughout the world, if you really think about it, right? And their story is one of unimaginable sacrifice, hard work, and faith in America. I’ve gotten a real glimpse—during the campaign, I’d go around with Ben to a lot of different places I wasn’t so familiar with. They’re incredible people. And I want to thank Ben Carson, who’s gonna be heading up HUD. That’s a big job. That’s a job that’s not only housing, but it’s mind and spirit. Right, Ben? And you understand, nobody’s gonna be better than Ben.\\n\\nLast month, we celebrated the life of Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., whose incredible example is unique in American history. You read all about Dr. Martin Luther King a week ago when somebody said I took the statue out of my office. It turned out that that was fake news. Fake news. The statue is cherished, it’s one of the favorite things in the—and we have some good ones. We have Lincoln, and we have Jefferson, and we have Dr. Martin Luther King. But they said the statue, the bust of Martin Luther King, was taken out of the office. And it was never even touched. So I think it was a disgrace, but that’s the way the press is. Very unfortunate.\\n\\nI am very proud now that we have a museum on the National Mall where people can learn about Reverend King, so many other things. Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody who’s done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I noticed. Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, and millions more black Americans who made America what it is today. Big impact.\\n\\nI’m proud to honor this heritage and will be honoring it more and more. The folks at the table in almost all cases have been great friends and supporters. Darrell—I met Darrell when he was defending me on television. And the people that were on the other side of the argument didn’t have a chance, right? And Paris has done an amazing job in a very hostile CNN community. He’s all by himself. You’ll have seven people, and Paris. And I’ll take Paris over the seven. But I don’t watch CNN, so I don’t get to see you as much as I used to. I don’t like watching fake news. But Fox has treated me very nice. Wherever Fox is, thank you.\\n\\nWe’re gonna need better schools and we need them soon. We need more jobs, we need better wages, a lot better wages. We’re gonna work very hard on the inner city. Ben is gonna be doing that, big league. That’s one of the big things that you’re gonna be looking at. We need safer communities and we’re going to do that with law enforcement. We’re gonna make it safe. We’re gonna make it much better than it is right now. Right now it’s terrible, and I saw you talking about it the other night, Paris, on something else that was really—you did a fantastic job the other night on a very unrelated show.\\n\\nI’m ready to do my part, and I will say this: We’re gonna work together. This is a great group, this is a group that’s been so special to me. You really helped me a lot. If you remember I wasn’t going to do well with the African-American community, and after they heard me speaking and talking about the inner city and lots of other things, we ended up getting—and I won’t go into details—but we ended up getting substantially more than other candidates who had run in the past years. And now we’re gonna take that to new levels. I want to thank my television star over here—Omarosa’s actually a very nice person, nobody knows that. I don’t want to destroy her reputation but she’s a very good person, and she’s been helpful right from the beginning of the campaign, and I appreciate it. I really do. Very special.\\n\\nSo I want to thank everybody for being here.'), ('Trump CIA Speech.txt', 'Well, I want to thank everybody.  Very, very special people.  And it is true, this is my first stop, officially.  We’re not talking about the balls, or we’re not talking about even the speeches -- although they did treat me nicely on that speech yesterday.    I always call them the dishonest media, but they treated me nicely.   \\n\\nBut I want to say that there is nobody that feels stronger about the intelligence community and the CIA than Donald Trump.  There’s nobody.   \\n\\nThe wall behind me is very, very special.  We’ve been touring for quite a while, and I’ll tell you what -- 29?  I can’t believe it.\\n\\nOh, 28.  We got to reduce it.  That’s amazing.  And we really appreciate what you’ve done in terms of showing us something very special.  And your whole group, these are really special, amazing people.  Very, very few people could do the job you people do.  And I want to just let you know, I am so behind you.  And I know maybe sometimes you haven’t gotten the backing that you’ve wanted, and you’re going to get so much backing.  Maybe you’re going to say, please don’t give us so much backing.    Mr. President, please, we don’t need that much backing.    But you’re going to have that.  And I think everybody in this room knows it.\\n\\nYou know, the military and the law enforcement, generally speaking, but all of it -- but the military gave us tremendous percentages of votes.  We were unbelievably successful in the election with getting the vote of the military.  And probably almost everybody in this room voted for me, but I will not ask you to raise your hands if you did.    But I would guarantee a big portion, because we’re all on the same wavelength, folks.    We’re all on the same wavelength, right?  He knows.  It took Brian about 30 seconds to figure that one out, right, because we know we’re on the same wavelength.\\n\\nBut we’re going to do great things.  We’re going to do great things.  We’ve been fighting these wars for longer than any wars we’ve ever fought.  We have not used the real abilities that we have.  We’ve been restrained.  We have to get rid of ISIS.  Have to get rid of ISIS.  We have no choice.    Radical Islamic terrorism.  And I said it yesterday -- it has to be eradicated just off the face of the Earth.  This is evil.  This is evil.  And you know, I can understand the other side.  We can all understand the other side.  There can be wars between countries, there can be wars.  You can understand what happened.  This is something nobody can even understand.  This is a level of evil that we haven’t seen.  And you’re going to go to it, and you’re going to do a phenomenal job.  But we’re going to end it.  It’s time.  It’s time right now to end it.\\n\\nYou have somebody coming on who is extraordinary.  For the different positions of “Secretary of This” and “Secretary of That” and all of these great positions, I’d see five, six, seven, eight people.  And we had a great transition.  We had an amazing team of talent.  And, by the way, General Flynn is right over here.  Put up your hand.  What a good guy.    And Reince and my whole group.  Reince -- you know -- they don’t care about Reince.  He’s like this political guy that turned out to be a superstar, right?  We don’t have to talk about Reince.\\n\\nBut we did -- we had such a tremendous, tremendous success.  So when I’m interviewing all of these candidates that Reince and his whole group is putting in front, it went very, very quickly, and, in this case, went so quickly -- because I would see six or seven or eight for Secretary of Agriculture, who we just named the other day, Sonny Perdue, former governor of Georgia.  Fantastic guy.  But I’d see six, seven, eight people for a certain position.  Everybody wanted it. \\n\\nBut I met Mike Pompeo, and it was the only guy I met.  I didn’t want to meet anybody else.  I said, cancel everybody else.  Cancel.  Now, he was approved, essentially, but they’re doing little political games with me.  He was one of the three.  Now, last night, as you know, General Mattis, fantastic guy, and General Kelly got approved.    And Mike Pompeo was supposed to be in that group.  It was going to be the three of them.  Can you imagine all of these guys?  People respect -- you know, they respect that military sense.  All my political people, they’re not doing so well.  The political people aren’t doing so well but you.  We’re going to get them all through, but some will take a little bit longer than others. \\n\\nBut Mike was literally -- I had a group of -- what, we had nine different people?  Now, I must say, I didn’t mind cancelling eight appointments.  That wasn’t the worst thing in the world.  But I met him and I said, he is so good.  Number one in his class at West Point. \\n\\nNow, I know a lot about West Point.  I’m a person that very strongly believes in academics.  In fact, every time I say I had an uncle who was a great professor at MIT for 35 years who did a fantastic job in so many different ways, academically -- was an academic genius -- and then they say, is Donald Trump an intellectual?  Trust me, I’m like a smart persona.    And I recognized immediately.  So he was number one at West Point, and he was also essentially number one at Harvard Law School.  And then he decided to go into the military.  And he ran for Congress.  And everything he’s done has been a homerun.  People like him, but much more importantly to me, everybody respects him.  And when I told Paul Ryan that I wanted to do this, I would say he may be the only person that was not totally thrilled -- right, Mike?  Because he said, I don’t want to lose this guy. \\n\\nBut you will be getting a total star.  You’re going to be getting a total gem.  He’s a gem.    You’ll see.  You’ll see.  And many of you know him anyway.  But you’re going to see.  And again, we have some great people going in.  But this one is something -- is going to be very special, because this is one, if I had to name the most important, this would certainly be perhaps -- you know, in certain ways, you could say my most important.  You do the job like everybody in this room is capable of doing.  And the generals are wonderful, and the fighting is wonderful.  But if you give them the right direction, boy, does the fighting become easier.  And, boy, do we lose so fewer lives, and win so quickly.  And that’s what we have to do.  We have to start winning again.\\n\\nYou know, when I was young and when I was -- of course, I feel young.  I feel like I’m 30, 35, 39.    Somebody said, are you young?  I said, I think I’m young.  You know, I was stopping -- when we were in the final month of that campaign, four stops, five stops, seven stops.  Speeches, speeches, in front of 25,000, 30,000 people, 15,000, 19,000 from stop to stop.  I feel young.\\n\\nWhen I was young -- and I think we’re all sort of young.  When I was young, we were always winning things in this country.  We’d win with trade.  We’d win with wars.  At a certain age, I remember hearing from one of my instructors, “The United States has never lost a war.”  And then, after that, it’s like we haven’t won anything.  We don’t win anymore.  The old expression, “to the victor belong the spoils” -- you remember.  I always used to say, keep the oil.  I wasn’t a fan of Iraq.  I didn’t want to go into Iraq.  But I will tell you, when we were in, we got out wrong.  And I always said, in addition to that, keep the oil.  Now, I said it for economic reasons.  But if you think about it, Mike, if we kept the oil you probably wouldn’t have ISIS because that’s where they made their money in the first place.  So we should have kept the oil.  But okay.    Maybe you’ll have another chance.  But the fact is, should have kept the oil. \\n\\nI believe that this group is going to be one of the most important groups in this country toward making us safe, toward making us winners again, toward ending all of the problems.  We have so many problems that are interrelated that we don’t even think of, but interrelated to the kind of havoc and fear that this sick group of people has caused.  So I can only say that I am with you 1,000 percent. \\n\\nAnd the reason you’re my first stop is that, as you know, I have a running war with the media.  They are among the most dishonest human beings on Earth.    And they sort of made it sound like I had a feud with the intelligence community.  And I just want to let you know, the reason you’re the number-one stop is exactly the opposite -- exactly.  And they understand that, too. \\n\\nAnd I was explaining about the numbers.  We did a thing yesterday at the speech.  Did everybody like the speech?    I’ve been given good reviews.  But we had a massive field of people.  You saw them.  Packed.  I get up this morning, I turn on one of the networks, and they show an empty field.  I say, wait a minute, I made a speech.  I looked out, the field was -- it looked like a million, million and a half people.  They showed a field where there were practically nobody standing there.  And they said, Donald Trump did not draw well.  I said, it was almost raining, the rain should have scared them away, but God looked down and he said, we’re not going to let it rain on your speech. \\n\\nIn fact, when I first started, I said, oh, no.  The first line, I got hit by a couple of drops.  And I said, oh, this is too bad, but we’ll go right through it.  But the truth is that it stopped immediately.  It was amazing.  And then it became really sunny.  And then I walked off and it poured right after I left.  It poured.  But, you know, we have something that’s amazing because we had -- it looked -- honestly, it looked like a million and a half people.  Whatever it was, it was.  But it went all the way back to the Washington Monument.  And I turn on -- and by mistake I get this network, and it showed an empty field.  And it said we drew 250,000 people.  Now, that’s not bad, but it’s a lie.  We had 250,000 people literally around -- you know, in the little bowl that we constructed.  That was 250,000 people.  The rest of the 20-block area, all the way back to the Washington Monument, was packed.  So we caught them, and we caught them in a beauty.  And I think they’re going to pay a big price. \\n\\nWe had another one yesterday, which was interesting.  In the Oval Office there’s a beautiful statue of Dr. Martin Luther King.  And I also happen to like Churchill, Winston Churchill.  I think most of us like Churchill.  He doesn’t come from our country, but had a lot to do with it.  Helped us; real ally.  And, as you know, the Churchill statue was taken out -- the bust.  And as you also probably have read, the Prime Minister is coming over to our country very shortly.  And they wanted to know whether or not I’d like it back.  I say, absolutely, but in the meantime we have a bust of Churchill. \\n\\nSo a reporter for Time magazine -- and I have been on there cover, like, 14 or 15 times.  I think we have the all-time record in the history of Time Magazine.  Like, if Tom Brady is on the cover, it’s one time, because he won the Super Bowl or something, right?    I’ve been on it for 15 times this year.  I don’t think that’s a record, Mike, that can ever be broken.  Do you agree with that?  What do you think? \\n\\nBut I will say that they said -- it was very interesting -- that Donald Trump took down the bust, the statue, of Dr. Martin Luther King.  And it was right there.  But there was a cameraman that was in front of it.    So Zeke -- Zeke from Time Magazine writes a story about I took down.  I would never do that because I have great respect for Dr. Martin Luther King.  But this is how dishonest the media is.\\n\\nNow, the big story -- the retraction was, like, where?  Was it a line?  Or do they even bother putting it in?  So I only like to say that because I love honesty.  I like honest reporting. \\n\\nI will tell you, final time -- although I will say it, when you let in your thousands of other people that have been trying to come in -- because I am coming back -- we’re going to have to get you a larger room.    We may have to get you a larger room.  You know?  And maybe, maybe, it will be built by somebody that knows how to build, and we won’t have columns.    You understand that?    We get rid of the columns.\\n\\nNo, I just wanted to really say that I love you, I respect you.  There’s nobody I respect more.  You’re going to do a fantastic job.  And we’re going to start winning again, and you’re going to be leading the charge. \\n\\nSo thank you all very much.    Thank you -- you’re beautiful.  Thank you all very much.  Have a good time.  I’ll be back.  I’ll be back.  Thank you.'), ('Trump Immigration Speech 8-31-16.txt', \"Wow. Thank you. That's a lot of people, Phoenix, that's a lot of people.\\n\\nThank you very much.\\n\\nThank you, Phoenix. I am so glad to be back in Arizona.\\n\\nThe state that has a very, very special place in my heart. I love people of Arizona and together we are going to win the White House in November.\\n\\nNow, you know this is where it all began for me. Remember that massive crowd also. So, I said let's go and have some fun tonight. We're going to Arizona, OK?\\n\\nThis will be a little bit different. This won't be a rally speech, per se. Instead, I'm going to deliver a detailed policy address on one of the greatest challenges facing our country today, illegal immigration.\\n\\nI've just landed having returned from a very important and special meeting with the President of Mexico, a man I like and respect very much. And a man who truly loves his country, Mexico.\\n\\nAnd, by the way, just like I am a man who loves my country, the United States.\\n\\nWe agree on the importance of ending the illegal flow of drugs, cash, guns, and people across our border, and to put the cartels out of business.\\n\\nWe also discussed the great contributions of Mexican-American citizens to our two countries, my love for the people of Mexico, and the leadership and friendship between Mexico and the United States. It was a thoughtful and substantive conversation and it will go on for awhile. And, in the end we're all going to win. Both countries, we're all going to win.\\n\\n\\nThis is the first of what I expect will be many, many conversations. And, in a Trump administration we're going to go about creating a new relationship between our two countries, but it's going to be a fair relationship. We want fairness.\\n\\nBut to fix our immigration system, we must change our leadership in Washington and we must change it quickly.\\n\\nSadly, sadly there is no other way. The truth is our immigration system is worse than anybody ever realized. But the facts aren't known because the media won't report on them. The politicians won't talk about them and the special interests spend a lot of money trying to cover them up because they are making an absolute fortune. That's the way it is.\\n\\nToday, on a very complicated and very difficult subject, you will get the truth. The fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is that it serves the needs of wealthy donors, political activists and powerful, powerful politicians. It's all you can do. Thank you. Thank you.\\n\\nLet me tell you who it does not serve. It does not serve you the American people. Doesn't serve you. When politicians talk about immigration reform, they usually mean the following, amnesty, open borders, lower wages. Immigration reform should mean something else entirely. It should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens.\\n\\nThank you. But if we're going to make our immigration system work, then we have to be prepared to talk honestly and without fear about these important and very sensitive issues. For instance, we have to listen to the concerns that working people, our forgotten working people, have over the record pace of immigration and it's impact on their jobs, wages, housing, schools, tax bills and general living conditions.\\n\\nThese are valid concerns expressed by decent and patriotic citizens from all backgrounds, all over. We also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate. Sometimes it's just not going to work out. It's our right, as a sovereign nation to chose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish and love us.\\n\\nThen there is the issue of security. Countless innocent American lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws like they have to be enforced. I have met with many of the great parents who lost their children to sanctuary cities and open borders. So many people, so many, many people. So sad. They will be joining me on this stage in a little while and I look forward to introducing, these are amazing, amazing people.\\n\\nCountless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this administration and the administration that causes this horrible, horrible thought process, called Hillary Clinton.\\n\\nThis includes incredible Americans like 21 year old Sarah Root. The man who killed her arrived at the border, entered Federal custody and then was released into the U.S., think of it, into the U.S. community under the policies of the White House Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Weak, weak policies. Weak and foolish policies.\\n\\nHe was released again after the crime, and now he's out there at large. Sarah had graduated from college with a 4.0, top student in her class one day before her death.\\n\\nAlso among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open borders policy was Grant Ronnebeck, a 21-year-old convenience store clerk and a really good guy from Mesa, Arizona. A lot of you have known about Grant. \\n\\nHe was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary, who had also been released from federal custody, and they knew it was going to happen again.\\n\\nAnother victim is Kate Steinle. Gunned down in the sanctuary city of San Francisco, by an illegal immigrant, deported five previous times. And they knew he was no good.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen there is the case of 90-year-old Earl Olander, who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home, 90 years old and defenseless. The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records a mile long, who did not meet Obama administration standards for removal. And they knew it was going to happen.\\n\\nIn California, a 64-year-old Air Force veteran, a great woman, according to everybody that knew her, Marilyn Pharis, was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer. Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions but was never, ever deported, despite the fact that everybody wanted him out.\\n\\nA 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens, in our prisons and jails together, had around 25,000 homicide arrests to their names, 25,000.\\n\\nOn top of that, illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion dollars a year.\\n\\nAnd this is what we get. For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next 10 years, we could provide 1 million at-risk students with a school voucher, which so many people are wanting.\\n\\nWhile there are many illegal immigrants in our country who are good people, many, many, this doesn't change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower skilled workers with less education, who compete directly against vulnerable American workers, and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they can ever possibly pay back.\\n\\nAnd they're hurting a lot of our people that cannot get jobs under any circumstances.\\n\\nBut these facts are never reported. Instead, the media and my opponent discuss one thing and only one thing, the needs of people living here illegally. In many cases, by the way, they're treated better than our vets.\\n\\nNot going to happen anymore, folks. November 8th. Not going to happen anymore.\\n\\nThe truth is, the central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants or however many there may be -- and honestly we've been hearing that number for years. It's always 11 million.\\n\\nOur government has no idea. It could be 3 million. It could be 30 million. They have no idea what the number is.\\n\\nFrankly our government has no idea what they're doing on many, many fronts, folks.\\n\\nBut whatever the number, that's never really been the central issue. It will never be a central issue. It doesn't matter from that standpoint. Anyone who tells you that the core issue is the needs of those living here illegally has simply spent too much time in Washington.\\n\\nOnly the out of touch media elites think the biggest problems facing America -- you know this, this is what they talk about, facing American society today is that there are 11 million illegal immigrants who don't have legal status. And, they also think the biggest thing, and you know this, it's not nuclear, and it's not ISIS, it's not Russia, it's not China, it's global warming.\\n\\nTo all the politicians, donors, and special interests, hear these words from me and all of you today. There is only one core issue in the immigration debate, and that issue is the well being of the American people.\\n\\nNothing even comes a close second. Hillary Clinton, for instance, talks constantly about her fears that families will be separated, but she's not talking about the American families who have been permanently separated from their loved ones because of a preventable homicide, because of a preventable death, because of murder.\\n\\nNo, she's only talking about families who come here in violation of the law. We will treat everyone living or residing in our country with great dignity. So important.\\n\\nWe will be fair, just, and compassionate to all, but our greatest compassion must be for our American citizens.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nPresident Obama and Hillary Clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the American people to open borders, and you know it better than anybody right here in Arizona. You know it.\\n\\nPresident Obama and Hillary Clinton support sanctuary cities. They support catch and release on the border. they support visa overstays. They support the release of dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, criminals from detention. And, they support unconstitutional executive amnesty.\\n\\nHillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security, and Medicare for illegal immigrants, breaking the federal budget.\\n\\nOn top of that she promises uncontrolled, low-skilled immigration that continues to reduce jobs and wages for American workers, and especially for African-American and Hispanic workers within our country. Our citizens.\\n\\nMost incredibly, because to me this is unbelievable, we have no idea who these people are, where they come from. I always say Trojan Horse. Watch what's going to happen, folks. It's not going to be pretty.\\n\\nThis includes her plan to bring in 620,000 new refugees from Syria and that region over a short period of time. And even yesterday, when you were watching the news, you saw thousands and thousands of people coming in from Syria. What is wrong with our politicians, our leaders if we can call them that. What the hell are we doing?\\n\\nHard to believe. Hard to believe. Now that you've heard about Hillary Clinton's plan, about which she has not answered a single question, let me tell you about my plan. And do you notice --\\n\\nAnd do you notice all the time for weeks and weeks of debating my plan, debating, talking about it, what about this, what about that. They never even mentioned her plan on immigration because she doesn't want to get into the quagmire. It's a tough one, she doesn't know what she's doing except open borders and let everybody come in and destroy our country by the way.\\n\\nWhile Hillary Clinton meets only with donors and lobbyists, my plan was crafted with the input from Federal Immigration offices, very great people. Among the top immigration experts anywhere in this country, who represent workers, not corporations, very important to us.\\n\\nI also worked with lawmakers, who've led on this issue on behalf of American citizens for many years. And most importantly I've met with the people directly impacted by these policies. So important.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nNumber one, are you ready? Are you ready?\\n\\nWe will build a great wall along the southern border. \\n\\nAnd Mexico will pay for the wall.\\n\\nOne hundred percent. They don't know it yet, but they're going to pay for it. And they're great people and great leaders but they're going to pay for the wall. On day one, we will begin working on intangible, physical, tall, power, beautiful southern border wall.\\n\\nWe will use the best technology, including above and below ground sensors that's the tunnels. Remember that, above and below.\\n\\nAbove and below ground sensors. Towers, aerial surveillance and manpower to supplement the wall, find and dislocate tunnels and keep out criminal cartels and Mexico you know that, will work with us. I really believe it. Mexico will work with us. I absolutely believe it. And especially after meeting with their wonderful, wonderful president today. I really believe they want to solve this problem along with us, and I'm sure they will.\\n\\nNumber two, we are going to end catch and release. We catch them, oh go ahead. We catch them, go ahead.\\n\\nUnder my administration, anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country and back to the country from which they came.\\n\\nAnd they'll be brought great distances. We're not dropping them right across. They learned that. President Eisenhower. They'd drop them across, right across, and they'd come back. And across.\\n\\nThen when they flew them to a long distance, all of a sudden that was the end. We will take them great distances. But we will take them to the country where they came from, OK?\\n\\nNumber three. Number three, this is the one, I think it's so great. It's hard to believe, people don't even talk about it. Zero tolerance for criminal aliens. Zero. Zero.\\n\\nZero. They don't come in here. They don't come in here.\\n\\nAccording to federal data, there are at least 2 million, 2 million, think of it, criminal aliens now inside of our country, 2 million people criminal aliens. We will begin moving them out day one. As soon as I take office. Day one. In joint operation with local, state, and federal law enforcement.\\n\\nNow, just so you understand, the police, who we all respect -- say hello to the police. Boy, they don't get the credit they deserve. I can tell you. They're great people. But the police and law enforcement, they know who these people are.\\n\\nThey live with these people. They get mocked by these people. They can't do anything about these people, and they want to. They know who these people are. Day one, my first hour in office, those people are gone.\\n\\nAnd you can call it deported if you want. The press doesn't like that term. You can call it whatever the hell you want. They're gone.\\n\\nBeyond the 2 million, and there are vast numbers of additional criminal illegal immigrants who have fled, but their days have run out in this country. The crime will stop. They're going to be gone. It will be over.\\n\\nThey're going out. They're going out fast.\\n\\nMoving forward. We will issue detainers for illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever, and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings if we even have to do that.\\n\\nWe will terminate the Obama administration's deadly, and it is deadly, non-enforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam our streets, walk around, do whatever they want to do, crime all over the place.\\n\\nThat's over. That's over, folks. That's over.\\n\\nSince 2013 alone, the Obama administration has allowed 300,000 criminal aliens to return back into United States communities. These are individuals encountered or identified by ICE, but who were not detained or processed for deportation because it wouldn't have been politically correct.\\n\\nMy plan also includes cooperating closely with local jurisdictions to remove criminal aliens immediately. We will restore the highly successful Secure Communities Program. Good program. We will expand and revitalize the popular 287(g) partnerships, which will help to identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails that we don't even know about.\\n\\nBoth of these programs have been recklessly gutted by this administration. And those were programs that worked.\\n\\nThis is yet one more area where we are headed in a totally opposite direction. There's no common sense, there's no brain power in our administration by our leader, or our leaders. None, none, none.\\n\\nHere’s an interesting graphic from a study published this summer on voting attitudes among people who heard incumbents use restrictive rhetoric on immigration -- tough enforcement, no amnesty, deportations -- and its affect on their own opinions.\\n\\nOn my first day in office I am also going to ask Congress to pass Kate's Law, named for Kate Steinle.\\n\\nTo ensure that criminal aliens convicted of illegal reentry receive strong mandatory minimum sentences. Strong.\\n\\nAnd then we get them out.\\n\\nAnother reform I'm proposing is the passage of legislation named for Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, to law enforcement officers recently killed by a previously deported illegal immigrant.\\n\\nThe Davis-Oliver bill will enhance cooperation with state and local authorities to ensure that criminal immigrants and terrorists are swiftly, really swiftly, identified and removed. And they will go face, believe me. They're going to go.\\n\\nWe're going to triple the number of ICE deportation officers.\\n\\nWithin ICE I am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice just like Hillary Clinton has evaded justice, OK?\\n\\nMaybe they'll be able to deport her.\\n\\nThe local police who know every one of these criminals, and they know each and every one by name, by crime, where they live, they will work so fast. And our local police will be so happy that they don't have to be abused by these thugs anymore. There's no great mystery to it, they've put up with it for years, and no finally we will turn the tables and law enforcement and our police will be allowed to clear up this dangerous and threatening mess.\\n\\nWe're also going to hire 5,000 more Border Patrol agents.\\n\\nWho gave me their endorsement, 16,500 gave me their endorsement.\\n\\nAnd put more of them on the border instead of behind desks which is good. We will expand the number of border patrol stations significantly.\\n\\nI've had a chance to spend time with these incredible law enforcement officers, and I want to take a moment to thank them. What they do is incredible.\\n\\nAnd getting their endorsement means so much to me. More to me really than I can say. Means so much. First time they've ever endorsed a presidential candidate.\\n\\nNumber four, block funding for sanctuary cities. We block the funding. No more funds.\\n\\nWe will end the sanctuary cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths. Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars, and we will work with Congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist federal authorities.\\n\\nNumber five, cancel unconstitutional executive orders and enforce all immigration laws.\\n\\nWe will immediately terminate President Obama's two illegal executive amnesties in which he defied federal law and the Constitution to give amnesty to approximately five million illegal immigrants, five million.\\n\\nAnd how about all the millions that are waiting on line, going through the process legally? So unfair.\\n\\nHillary Clinton has pledged to keep both of these illegal amnesty programs, including the 2014 amnesty which has been blocked by the United States Supreme Court. Great.\\n\\nClinton has also pledged to add a third executive amnesty. And by the way, folks, she will be a disaster for our country, a disaster in so many other ways.\\n\\nAnd don't forget the Supreme Court of the United States. Don't forget that when you go to vote on November 8. And don't forget your Second Amendment. And don't forget the repeal and replacement of Obamacare.\\n\\nAnd don't forget building up our depleted military. And don't forget taking care of our vets. Don't forget our vets. They have been forgotten.\\n\\nClinton's plan would trigger a constitutional crisis unlike almost anything we have ever seen before. In effect, she would be abolishing the lawmaking powers of Congress in order to write her own laws from the Oval Office. And you see what bad judgment she has. She has seriously bad judgment.\\n\\nCan you imagine? In a Trump administration all immigration laws will be enforced, will be enforced. As with any law enforcement activity, we will set priorities. But unlike this administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement. And ICE and Border Patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs the way their jobs are supposed to be done.\\n\\nAnyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation. That is what it means to have laws and to have a country. Otherwise we don't have a country.\\n\\nOur enforcement priorities will include removing criminals, gang members, security threats, visa overstays, public charges. That is those relying on public welfare or straining the safety net along with millions of recent illegal arrivals and overstays who've come here under this current corrupt administration.\\n\\n\\nNumber six, we are going to suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur.\\n\\nAccording to data provided by the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration, and the national interest between 9/11 and the end of 2014, at least 380 foreign born individuals were convicted in terror cases inside the United States. And even right now the largest number of people are under investigation for exactly this that we've ever had in the history of our country.\\n\\nOur country is a mess. We don't even know what to look for anymore, folks. Our country has to straighten out. And we have to straighten out fast.\\n\\nThe number is likely higher. But the administration refuses to provide this information, even to Congress. As soon as I enter office I am going to ask the Department of State, which has been brutalized by Hillary Clinton, brutalized.\\n\\nHomeland Security and the Department of Justice to begin a comprehensive review of these cases in order to develop a list of regions and countries from which immigration must be suspended until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put in place.\\n\\nI call it extreme vetting right? Extreme vetting. I want extreme. It's going to be so tough, and if somebody comes in that's fine but they're going to be good. It's extreme.\\n\\nAnd if people don't like it, we've got have a country folks. Got to have a country. Countries in which immigration will be suspended would include places like Syria and Libya. And we are going to stop the tens of thousands of people coming in from Syria. We have no idea who they are, where they come from. There's no documentation. There's no paperwork. It's going to end badly folks. It's going to end very, very badly.\\n\\nFor the price of resettling, one refugee in the United States, 12 could be resettled in a safe zone in their home region. Which I agree with 100 percent. We have to build safe zones and we'll get the money from Gulf states. We don't want to put up the money. We owe almost $20 trillion. Doubled since Obama took office, our national debt.\\n\\nBut we will get the money from Gulf states and others. We'll supervise it. We'll build safe zones which is something that I think all of us want to see.\\n\\nAnother reform, involves new screening tests for all applicants that include, and this is so important, especially if you get the right people. And we will get the right people. An ideological certification to make sure that those we are admitting to our country share our values and love our people.\\n\\nThank you. We're very proud of our country. Aren't we? Really? With all it's going through, we're very proud of our country. For instance, in the last five years, we've admitted nearly 100,000 immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan. And these two countries according to Pew Research, a majority of residents say that the barbaric practice of honor killings against women are often or sometimes justified. That's what they say.\\n\\nThat's what they say. They're justified. Right? And we're admitting them to our country. Applicants will be asked their views about honor killings, about respect for women and gays and minorities. Attitudes on radical Islam, which our President refuses to say and many other topics as part of this vetting procedure. And if we have the right people doing it, believe me, very, very few will slip through the cracks. Hopefully, none.\\n\\n\\nNumber seven, we will insure that other countries take their people back when they order them deported.\\n\\nThere are at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after they've been ordered to leave the United States. Including large numbers of violent criminals, they won't take them back. So we say, OK, we'll keep them. Not going to happen with me, not going to happen with me.\\n\\nDue to a Supreme Court decision, if these violent offenders cannot be sent home, our law enforcement officers have to release them into your communities.\\n\\nAnd by the way, the results are horrific, horrific. There are often terrible consequences, such as Casey Chadwick's tragic death in Connecticut just last year. Yet despite the existence of a law that commands the Secretary of State to stop issuing visas to these countries.\\n\\nSecretary Hillary Clinton ignored this law and refused to use this powerful tool to bring nations into compliance. And, they would comply if we would act properly.\\n\\nIn other words, if we had leaders that knew what they were doing, which we don't.\\n\\nThe result of her misconduct was the release of thousands and thousands of dangerous criminal aliens who should have been sent home to their countries. Instead we have them all over the place. Probably a couple in this room as a matter of fact, but I hope not.\\n\\nAccording to a report for the Boston Globe from the year 2008 to 2014 nearly 13,000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S. communities because their home countries would not, under any circumstances, take them back. Hard to believe with the power we have. Hard to believe.\\n\\nWe're like the big bully that keeps getting beat up. You ever see that? The big bully that keeps getting beat up.\\n\\nThese 13,000 release occurred on Hillary Clinton's watch. She had the power and the duty to stop it cold, and she decided she would not do it.\\n\\nAnd, Arizona knows better than most exactly what I'm talking about.\\n\\n\\nThose released include individuals convicted of killings, sexual assaults, and some of the most heinous crimes imaginable.\\n\\nThe Boston Globe writes that a Globe review of 323 criminals released in New England from 2008 to 2012 found that as many as 30 percent committed new offenses, including rape, attempted murder, and child molestation. We take them, we take them.\\n\\nNumber eight, we will finally complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system which we need desperately. For years Congress has required biometric entry-exit visa tracking systems, but it has never been completed. The politicians are all talk, no action, never happens. Never happens.\\n\\nHillary Clinton, all talk. Unfortunately when there is action it's always the wrong decision. You ever notice? In my administration we will ensure that this system is in place. And, I will tell you, it will be on land, it will be on sea, it will be in air. We will have a proper tracking system.\\n\\nApproximately half of new illegal immigrants came on temporary visas and then never, ever left. Why should the? Nobody's telling them to leave. Stay as long as you want, we'll take care of you.\\n\\nBeyond violating our laws, visa overstays, pose -- and they really are a big problem, pose a substantial threat to national security. The 9/11 Commission said that this tracking system would be a high priority and would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials in august and September in 2001 in conducting a search for two of the 9/11 hijackers that were in the United States expired visas.\\n\\nAnd, you know what that would have meant, what that could have meant. Wouldn't that have been wonderful, right? What that could have meant?\\n\\nLast year alone nearly half a million individuals overstayed their temporary visas. Removing these overstays will be a top priority of my administration.\\n\\nIf people around the world believe they can just come on a temporary visa and never, ever leave, the Obama-Clinton policy, that's what it is, then we have a completely open border, and we no longer have a country.\\n\\nWe must send a message that visa expiration dates will be strongly enforced.\\n\\nNumber nine, we will turn off the jobs and benefits magnet.\\n\\nWe will ensure that E-Verify is used to the fullest extent possible under existing law, and we will work with Congress to strengthen and expand its use across the country.\\n\\nImmigration law doesn't exist for the purpose of keeping criminals out. It exists to protect all aspects of American life. The work site, the welfare office, the education system, and everything else.\\n\\nThat is why immigration limits are established in the first place. If we only enforced the laws against crime, then we have an open border to the entire world. We will enforce all of our immigration laws.\\n\\nAnd the same goes for government benefits. The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that 62 percent of households headed by illegal immigrants use some form of cash or non-cash welfare programs like food stamps or housing assistance.\\n\\nTremendous costs, by the way, to our country. Tremendous costs. This directly violates the federal public charge law designed to protect the United States Treasury. Those who abuse our welfare system will be priorities for immediate removal.\\n\\nNumber 10, we will reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workers, the forgotten people. Workers. We're going to take care of our workers.\\n\\nAnd by the way, and by the way, we're going to make great trade deals. We're going to renegotiate trade deals. We're going to bring our jobs back home. We're going to bring our jobs back home.\\n\\nWe have the most incompetently worked trade deals ever negotiated probably in the history of the world, and that starts with NAFTA. And now they want to go TPP, one of the great disasters.\\n\\nWe're going to bring our jobs back home. And if companies want to leave Arizona and if they want to leave other states, there's going to be a lot of trouble for them. It's not going to be so easy. There will be consequence. Remember that. There will be consequence. They're not going to be leaving, go to another country, make the product, sell it into the United States, and all we end up with is no taxes and total unemployment. It's not going to happen. There will be consequences.\\n\\nWe've admitted 59 million immigrants to the United States between 1965 and 2015. Many of these arrivals have greatly enriched our country. So true. But we now have an obligation to them and to their children to control future immigration as we are following, if you think, previous immigration waves.\\n\\nWe've had some big waves. And tremendously positive things have happened. Incredible things have happened. To ensure assimilation we want to ensure that it works. Assimilation, an important word. Integration and upward mobility.\\n\\nWithin just a few years immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records. The time has come for a new immigration commission to develop a new set of reforms to our legal immigration system in order to achieve the following goals.\\n\\nTo keep immigration levels measured by population share within historical norms. To select immigrants based on their likelihood of success in U.S. society and their ability to be financially self- sufficient.\\n\\nWe take anybody. Come on in, anybody. Just come on in. Not anymore.\\n\\nYou know, folks, it's called a two-way street. It is a two-way street, right? We need a system that serves our needs, not the needs of others. Remember, under a Trump administration it's called America first. Remember that.\\n\\nTo choose immigrants based on merit. Merit, skill, and proficiency. Doesn't that sound nice? And to establish new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first. And that in particular African- American and Latino workers who are being shut out in this process so unfairly.\\n\\nAnd Hillary Clinton is going to do nothing for the African- American worker, the Latino worker. She's going to do nothing. Give me your vote, she says, on November eighth. And then she'll say, so long, see you in four years. That's what it is.\\n\\nShe is going to do nothing. And just look at the past. She's done nothing. She's been there for 35 years. She's done nothing. And I say what do you have to lose? Choose me. Watch how good we're going to do together. Watch.\\n\\nYou watch. We want people to come into our country, but they have to come into our country legally and properly vetted, and in a manner that serves the national interest. We've been living under outdated immigration rules from decades ago. They're decades and decades old.\\n\\nTo avoid this happening in the future, I believe we should sunset our visa laws so that Congress is forced to periodically revise and revisit them to bring them up to date. They're archaic. They're ancient. We wouldn't put our entire federal budget on auto pilot for decades, so why should we do the same for the very, very complex subject of immigration?\\n\\nSo let's now talk about the big picture. These 10 steps, if rigorously followed and enforced, will accomplish more in a matter of months than our politicians have accomplished on this issue in the last 50 years. It's going to happen, folks. Because I am proudly not a politician, because I am not behold to any special interest, I've spent a lot of money on my campaign, I'll tell you. I write those checks. Nobody owns Trump.\\n\\nI will get this done for you and for your family. We'll do it right. You'll be proud of our country again. We'll do it right. We will accomplish all of the steps outlined above. And, when we do, peace and law and justice and prosperity will prevail. Crime will go down. Border crossings will plummet. Gangs will disappear.\\n\\nAnd the gangs are all over the place. And welfare use will decrease. We will have a peace dividend to spend on rebuilding America, beginning with our American inner cities. We're going to rebuild them, for once and for all.\\n\\nFor those here illegally today, who are seeking legal status, they will have one route and one route only. To return home and apply for reentry like everybody else, under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined above. Those who have left to seek entry --\\n\\nThank you. Thank you. Those who have left to seek entry under this new system -- and it will be an efficient system -- will not be awarded surplus visas, but will have to apply for entry under the immigration caps or limits that will be established in the future.\\n\\nWe will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration. We will break the cycle. There will be no amnesty.\\n\\nOur message to the world will be this. You cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the United States by illegally entering our country. Can't do it.\\n\\nThis declaration alone will help stop the crisis of illegal crossings and illegal overstays, very importantly. People will know that you can't just smuggle in, hunker down and wait to be legalized. It's not going to work that way. Those days are over.\\n\\nImportantly, in several years when we have accomplished all of our enforcement and deportation goals and truly ended illegal immigration for good, including the construction of a great wall, which we will have built in record time. And at a reasonable cost, which you never hear from the government.\\n\\nAnd the establishment of our new lawful immigration system then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain.\\n\\nThat discussion can take place only in an atmosphere in which illegal immigration is a memory of the past, no longer with us, allowing us to weigh the different options available based on the new circumstances at the time.\\n\\nRight now, however, we're in the middle of a jobs crisis, a border crisis and a terrorism crisis like never before. All energies of the federal government and the legislative process must now be focused on immigration security. That is the only conversation we should be having at this time, immigration security. Cut it off.\\n\\nWhether it's dangerous materials being smuggled across the border, terrorists entering on visas or Americans losing their jobs to foreign workers, these are the problems we must now focus on fixing. And the media needs to begin demanding to hear Hillary Clinton's answer on how her policies will affect Americans and their security.\\n\\nThese are matters of life and death for our country and its people, and we deserve answers from Hillary Clinton. And do you notice, she doesn't answer.\\n\\nShe didn't go to Louisiana. She didn't go to Mexico. She was invited.\\n\\nShe doesn't have the strength or the stamina to make America great again. Believe me.\\n\\nWhat we do know, despite the lack of media curiosity, is that Hillary Clinton promises a radical amnesty combined with a radical reduction in immigration enforcement. Just ask the Border Patrol about Hillary Clinton. You won't like what you're hearing.\\n\\nThe result will be millions more illegal immigrants; thousands of more violent, horrible crimes; and total chaos and lawlessness. That's what's going to happen, as sure as you're standing there.\\n\\nThis election, and I believe this, is our last chance to secure the border, stop illegal immigration and reform our laws to make your life better. I really believe this is it. This is our last time. November 8. November 8. You got to get out and vote on November 8.\\n\\nIt's our last chance. It's our last chance. And that includes Supreme Court justices and Second Amendment. Remember that.\\n\\nSo I want to remind everyone what we're fighting for and who we are fighting for.\\n\\nI am going to ask -- these are really special people that I've gotten to know. I’m going to ask all the Angel Moms to come join me on the stage right now. These are amazing women.\\n\\nThese are amazing people.\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nThese are amazing people, and I am not asking for their endorsement, believe me that. I just think I've gotten to know so many of them, and many more, from our group. But they are incredible people and what they're going through is incredible, and there's just no reason for it. Let's give them a really tremendous hand.\\n\\nThat's tough stuff, I will tell you. That is tough stuff. Incredible people.\\n\\nSo, now is the time for these voices to be heard. Now is the time for the media to begin asking questions on their behalf. Now is the time for all of us as one country, Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative to band together to deliver justice, and safety, and security for all Americans.\\n\\nLet's fix this horrible, horrible, problem. It can be fixed quickly. Let's our secure our border.\\n\\nLet's stop the drugs and the crime from pouring into our country. Let's protect our social security and Medicare. Let's get unemployed Americans off the welfare and back to work in their own country.\\n\\nThis has been an incredible evening. We're going to remember this evening. November 8, we have to get everybody. This is such an important state. November 8 we have to get everybody to go out and vote.\\n\\nWe're going to bring -- thank you, thank you. We're going to take our country back, folks. This is a movement. We're going to take our country back.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nThis is an incredible movement. The world is talking about it. The world is talking about it and by the way, if you haven't been looking to what's been happening at the polls over the last three or four days I think you should start looking. You should start looking.\\n\\nTogether we can save American lives, American jobs, and American futures. Together we can save America itself. Join me in this mission, we're going to make America great again.\\n\\nThank you. I love you. God bless you, everybody. God bless you. God bless you, thank you.\"), ('Trump Police Chiefs Speech.txt', 'Thank you very much. This is — great to be with people I truly feel comfortable with. Please sit down. They’ll say I didn’t get a standing ovation because they never sat down. And I say, I got one standing ovation because they never sat down. \\n\\nBut I want to thank you. I have great, great love for what you do and the way you do it. And when I’m with the police chiefs and I’m with the sheriffs of our country — and these are the big ones. These are the really big ones. I just want to thank you very much. And I thought before I spoke about what we’re really here to speak about, I would read something to you. Because you can be a lawyer, or you don’t have to be a lawyer; if you were a good student in high school or a bad student in high school, you can understand this. \\n\\nAnd it’s really incredible to me that we have a court case that’s going on so long. As you know, in Boston, we won it with a highly respected judge and a very strong opinion, but now we’re in an era that, let’s just say, they are interpreting things differently than probably 100 percent of the people in this room. I’d like to almost know, does anybody disagree when I read this.\\n \\n\\nBut I’m going to read what’s in dispute, what’s in question. And you will see this — it’s INA 212(f) 8 U.S.C. 1182(f): “Suspension of entry or imposition of restrictions by the President” — okay, now, this isn’t just me, this is for Obama, for Ronald Reagan, for the President. And this was done, very importantly, for security — something you people know more about than all of us. It was done for the security of our nation, the security of our citizens, so that people come in who aren’t going to do us harm.\\n\\nAnd that’s why it was done. And it couldn’t have been written any more precisely. It’s not like, oh, gee, we wish it were written better. It was written beautifully. So just listen, here’s what it says. This is what they’re arguing: \\n\\n\"Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens\" — okay, the entry, the entry of any aliens — \"or of any class of aliens\" — so any aliens, any class of aliens — \"into the United States\" — so the entry of people into the United States. Let’s say, just to be precise, of aliens into the United States. \\n\\nSo any time — \"whenever the President finds that the entry of any alien or any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States\" — right? So if I find, as President, that a person or group of people will be detrimental to the interests of the United States — and certainly there’s lots of examples that we have, but you shouldn’t even have them, necessarily — he may be — and \"he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary…\" Now, the only mistake is they should have said \"he or she.\" But hopefully, it won’t be a she for at least another seven years. After that, I’m all — (laughter and applause.) See? I just noticed that, actually. I just noticed it. I’m saying, whoa, this is not politically correct. It’s correct, but it’s not politically correct, you know, this is the old days.\\n\\nHe may by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary — so here it is, people coming in — suspend the entry of all aliens. Right? That’s what it says. It’s not like — again, a bad high school student would understand this. Anybody would understand this. Suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens. Okay, so you can suspend the aliens, right? You can suspend the aliens from coming in — very strong — or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\\n\\nOkay. So you can suspend, you can put restrictions, you can do whatever you want. And this is for the security of the country — which, again, you’re the chiefs, you’re the sheriffs. You understand this. \\n\\nAnd I listened to lawyers on both sides last night, and they were talking about things that had just nothing to do with it. I listened to a panel of judges, and I’ll comment on that — I will not comment on the statements made by certainly one judge. But I have to be honest that if these judges wanted to, in my opinion, help the court in terms of respect for the court, they\\'d what they should be doing. I mean, it’s so sad. \\n\\nThey should be — when you read something so simple and so beautifully written, and so perfectly written — other than the one statement, of course, having to do with he or she — but when you read something so perfectly written and so clear to anybody, and then you have lawyers and you watched — I watched last night in amazement, and I heard things that I couldn’t believe, things that really had nothing to do with what I just read. \\n\\nAnd I don’t ever want to call a court biased, so I won’t call it biased. And we haven’t had a decision yet. But courts seem to be so political, and it would be so great for our justice system if they would be able to read a statement and do what’s right. And that has to do with the security of our country, which is so important.\\n\\nRight now, we are at risk because of what happened. General Kelly is an extremely talented man and a very good man — now Secretary Kelly, Homeland Security. We are doing our job. He’s a great man.  We’re doing our job. And one of the reasons you probably heard that we did it so quickly — in fact, I said, let’s give a one-month notice, and then law enforcement — and General Kelly was so great because he said, we totally knew about it. We knew about everything. We do things well. We did things right.\\n\\nBut the law enforcement people said to me, oh, you can’t give a notice, because if you give a notice that you’re going to be really tough in one month from now, or in one week from now — I suggested a month and I said, well, what about a week? They said, no, you can’t do that, because then people are going to pour in before the toughness goes on. Do you people agree? I mean, you know more about law than anybody, law enforcement.  \\n\\nSo I wanted to give, like, a month. Then I said, well, what about a week? They said, well, then you’re going to have a whole pile of people perhaps — perhaps — with very evil intentions coming in before the restrictions. \\n\\nSo there it is, folks. It’s as plain as you can have it. I didn’t — and I was a good student. I understand things. I comprehend very well, okay? Better than I think almost anybody. And I want to tell you, I listened to a bunch of stuff last night on television that was disgraceful. It was disgraceful. Because what I just read to you is what we have, and it just can’t be written any plainer or better. And for us to be going through this — and, by the way, a highly, highly respected judge in Boston ruled very strongly in our favor. You heard that.\\n\\nIn fact, I said to my people, why don’t you use the Boston case? And there were reasons why they couldn’t use the Boston case. This one came later for various reasons. But use the Boston case. And I won’t read that, but there were statements made by that judge — who, again, highly respected — that were right on. They were perfect. They were perfect.\\n\\nSo I think it’s sad. I think it’s a sad day. I think our security is at risk today. And it will be at risk until such time as we are entitled and get what we are entitled to as citizens of this country. As chiefs, as sheriffs of this country, we want security. \\n\\nOne of the reasons I was elected was because of law and order and security. It’s one of the reasons I was elected. Also jobs and lots of other things. But I think one of the strongest reasons is security. And they’re taking away our weapons one by one, that’s what they’re doing. And you know it and I know it, and you people have been very unhappy for a long period of time. And I can read the polls maybe better than anybody because it seems that I understood the polls a lot better than many of the pollsters understood the polls — assuming they were honest polls, which I think probably many of them weren’t. I really believe that.   \\n\\nBut we need security in our country. We have to allow you folks to do your job. You’re great people, great people. Great men and women. And we have to allow you to do your job. And we have to give you the weapons that you need. And this is a weapon that you need. And they’re trying to take it away from you, maybe because of politics or maybe because of political views. We can’t let that happen.\\n\\nSo with that, let’s get on to business, right? It’s really something. Thank you.  \\n\\nI want to thank Sheriff Sandra Hutchens and Chief Tom Manger for your leadership and, frankly, for the service. You have had great service. Everyone has told me about you two legendary people. All of us here today are united by one shared mission: to serve and protect the public of the United States.\\n\\nDuring my campaign for President, I had the chance to spend time with law enforcement officials all across our country. They are the most incredible people you will ever meet. And I just wanted to say to all of them right now, from the bottom of my heart, thank you, thank you, thank you.  \\n\\nThere are many actions we in the federal government can take to help improve safety in your communities. But I believe that community safety begins with moral leadership. Our police officers, sheriffs and deputies risk their lives every day. And they’re entitled to an administration that has their back.  \\n\\nThe first step in restoring public safety is affirming our confidence in the men and women charged with upholding our laws. And I’m going to add justices, judges in that category. And I’m very proud to have picked Judge Gorsuch, who I think is going to be an outstanding member of the Supreme Court — outstanding.  \\n\\nSo I’d like to begin my remarks with a declaration issued to all of you, and delivered to every member of the law enforcement community all across the United States. My message today is that you have a true, true friend in the White House. You have.  I stand with you. I support our police. I support our sheriffs. And we support the men and women of law enforcement.  \\n\\nRight now, many communities in America are facing a public safety crisis. Murders in 2015 experienced their largest single-year increase in nearly half a century. In 2016, murders in large cities continued to climb by double digits. In many of our biggest cities, 2016 brought an increase in the number of homicides, rapes, assaults and shootings. In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone, and the rate so far this year has been even higher. What is going on in Chicago? \\n\\nWe cannot allow this to continue. We’ve allowed too many young lives to be claimed — and you see that, you see that all over — claimed by gangs, and too many neighborhoods to be crippled by violence and fear. Sixty percent of murder victims under the age of 22 are African American. This is a national tragedy, and it requires national action. This violence must end, and we must all work together to end it.\\n\\nWhether a child lives in Detroit, Chicago, Baltimore, or anywhere in our country, he or she has the right to grow up in safety and in peace. No one in America should be punished because of the city where he or she is born. Every child in America should be able to play outside without fear, walk home without danger, and attend a school without being worried about drugs or gangs or violence.\\n\\nSo many lives and so many people have been cut short. Their potential, their life has been cut short. So much potential has been sidelined. And so many dreams have been shattered and broken, totally broken. It’s time to stop the drugs from pouring into our country. And, by the way, we will do that. And I will say this: General, now Secretary, Kelly will be the man to do it, and we will give him a wall. And it will be a real wall.  And a lot of things will happen very positively for your cities, your states, believe me. The wall is getting designed right now. A lot of people say, oh, oh, Trump was only kidding with the wall. I wasn’t kidding. I don’t kid. I don’t kid. I watch this, and they say I was kidding. No, I don’t kid. I don’t kid about things like that, I can tell you. No, we will have a wall. It will be a great wall, and it will do a lot of — will be a big help. Just ask Israel about walls. Do walls work? Just ask Israel. They work — if it’s properly done. \\n\\nIt’s time to dismantle the gangs terrorizing our citizens, and it’s time to ensure that every young American can be raised in an environment of decency, dignity, love and support. You have asked for the resources, tools and support you need to get the job done. We will do whatever we can to help you meet those demands. That includes a zero tolerance policy for acts of violence against law enforcement.  We all see what happens. We all see what happens and what’s been happening to you. It’s not fair. \\n\\nWe must protect those who protect us. The number of officers shot and killed in the line of duty last year increased by 56 percent from the year before. Last year, in Dallas, police officers were targeted for execution –- think of this. Who ever heard of this? They were targeted for execution. Twelve were shot and five were killed. These heroic officers died as they lived -– protecting the innocent, rushing into danger, risking their lives for people they did not even know, but for people that they were determined to save. Hats off to you people.\\n\\nThese slain officers are an eternal monument to all of the men and women who protect our streets and serve our public. We will not forget them, and we will not forget all of the others who made that final sacrifice in the line of duty.\\n\\nGod has blessed our nation to put these heroes among us. Those who serve in law enforcement work long hours. You work long hours. I know so many sheriffs, so many chiefs, so many police who work long hours and dangerous hours, oftentimes in difficult conditions and for not that much pay relative to what you’re doing. They do it because they care. \\n\\nWe must work with them, not against them. They’re working against you. For many years they’ve been working against you. We must support them, not undermine them. And instead of division and disunity — and which is so much disunity — we must build bridges of partnership and of trust. Those who demonize law enforcement or who use the actions of a few to discredit the service of many are hurting the very people they say that they want to help. When policing is reduced, crime is increased, and our poorest citizens suffer the most. And I see it all the time. When the number of police goes down, crime goes up.\\n\\nTo build needed trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve, it is not enough for us to merely talk to each other. We must listen to each other. All of us share the view that those in uniform must be held to the highest possible standard of conduct — so important. \\n\\nYou\\'re the role models to young Americans all across this country, many of whom want to go into law enforcement, many of whom want to be a sheriff or a police chief, many of whom — they have great respect for you. Tremendous respect. You don\\'t even realize it, but I will tell you, they have great respect and admiration for the people in this room and the people that you represent. And don\\'t let anyone ever tell you different. Don\\'t let the dishonest media try and convince you that it\\'s different than that, because it\\'s not.   \\n\\nThat is why our commitment to law and law enforcement also includes ensuring that we are giving departments the resources they need to train, recruit and retain talent. As part of our commitment to safe communities, we will also work to address the mental health crisis. Prisons should not be a substitute for treatment. We will fight to increase access to life-saving treatment to battle the addiction to drugs, which is afflicting our nation like never ever before — ever.   \\n\\nI\\'ve been here two weeks. I\\'ve met a lot of law enforcement officials. Yesterday, I brought them into the Oval Office. I asked a group, what impact do drugs have in terms of a percentage on crime? They said, 75 to 80 percent. That\\'s pretty sad. We\\'re going to stop the drugs from pouring in. We\\'re going to stop those drugs from poisoning our youth, from poisoning our people. We\\'re going to be ruthless in that fight. We have no choice.\\n\\nAnd we\\'re going to take that fight to the drug cartels and work to liberate our communities from their terrible grip of violence. You have the power and knowledge to tell General Kelly — now Secretary Kelly — who the illegal immigrant gang members are. Now, you have that power because you know them, you\\'re there, you\\'re local. You know the illegals, you know them by their first name, you know them by their nicknames. You have that power. The federal government can never be that precise. But you\\'re in the neighborhoods — you know the bad ones, you know the good ones. \\n\\nI want you to turn in the bad ones. Call Secretary Kelly\\'s representatives and we\\'ll get them out of our country and bring them back where they came from, and we\\'ll do it fast. You have to call up the federal government, Homeland Security, because so much of the problems — you look at Chicago and you look at other places. So many of the problems are caused by gang members, many of whom are not even legally in our country.\\n\\nAnd we will work with you on the frontlines to keep America safe from terrorism, which is what I began this with. Terrorism — a tremendous threat, far greater than people in our country understand. Believe me. I\\'ve learned a lot in the last two weeks. And terrorism is a far greater threat than the people of our country understand. But we\\'re going to take care of it. We\\'re going to win. We\\'re going to take care of it, folks.\\n\\nLet today be the beginning of a great national partnership. Let today serve as a great call to action. And let this moment represent a new beginning in relations between law enforcement and our communities. I want you to know the American public totally stands with you. I want you to know the American people support you. I want you to know how proud we are, truly proud, to know you. \\n\\nWe applaud your efforts. We thank you for your service. And we promise that you will always find an open door at the White House — an open invitation to our great cops and sheriffs nationwide. They\\'re great people. You are great people.\\n\\nThank you. God bless you. And God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you.'), ('Trump National Prayer Breakfast.txt', 'Thank you, Mark.  So nice.  \\n  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  It’s a great honor to be here this morning.  And so many faith leaders — very, very important people to me — from across our magnificent nation, and so many leaders from all across the globe.\\nToday we continue a tradition begun by President Eisenhower some 64 years ago.  This gathering is a testament to the power of faith, and is one of the great customs of our nation, and I hope to be here seven more times with you.  (Laughter and applause.)\\nI want very much to thank our co-chairs, Senator Bowzman and Senator Coons, and all of the congressional leadership — they’re all over the place.  We have a lot of very distinguished guests.\\nAnd we have one guest who was just sworn in last night — Rex Tillerson, Secretary of State.  \\n  Going to do a great job.  Some people didn’t like Rex because he actually got along with leaders of the world.  I said, no, you have to understand, that’s a good thing.  \\n  That’s a good thing, not a bad thing.  He’s respected all over the world, and I think he’s going to go down as one of our great, great secretaries.  We appreciate it.  Thank you, thank you, Rex.  \\n\\nThank you as well to Senate Chaplain Barry Black for his moving words.  And I don’t know, Chaplain, whether or not that’s an appointed position.  Is that an appointed position?  I don’t even know if you’re a Democrat or if you’re a Republican, but I’m appointing you for another year — the hell with it.  (Laughter and applause.)  And I think it’s not even my appointment, it’s the Senate’s appointment, but we’ll talk to them.  Your son is here.  Your job is very, very secure, okay?  \\n  Thank you, Barry.  Appreciate it very much.\\nI also want to thank my great friends, though, Roma.  Where’s Roma?  Beautiful Roma Downey.  The voice of an angel.  She’s got the voice — every time I hear it, that voice is so beautiful.  Everything is so beautiful about Roma, including her husband because he’s a special, special friend, Mark Burnett — for the wonderful introduction.  So true.  So true.  I said to the agent, I’m sorry.  The only thing more — I actually got on the phone and fired him myself because he said, you don’t want to do it, it’ll never work, it’ll never, ever work.  You don’t want to do it.  I said, listen — but I really fired him after it became the number-one show.  It became so successful, and he wanted a commission, and he didn’t want to do it.  That’s what I really said.  \\n\\nBut we had tremendous success on “The Apprentice.”  And when I ran for President, I had to leave the show.  That’s when I knew for sure I was doing it.  And they hired a big, big movie star — Arnold Schwarzenegger -– to take my place.  And we know how that turned out.  \\n  The ratings went right down the tubes.  It’s been a total disaster.  And Mark will never, ever bet against Trump again.  And I want to just pray for Arnold, if we can, for those ratings, okay?  \\n\\nBut we’ve had an amazing life together, the last 14, 15 years.  And an outstanding man, and thank you very much for introducing me.  Appreciate it.  It’s a great honor.  \\n\\nI also want to thank my dear friend, Vice President Mike Pence, who has been incredible.  \\n  And incredible wife, Karen.  And every time I was in a little trouble with something, where they were questioning me, they’d say, but he picked Mike Pence — (laughter) — so he has to know what he’s doing.  And it’s true, he’s been — you know, on the scale of 0 to 10, I rate him a 12, okay?  So I want to thank you.  Thank you very much.  Apprentice it.  \\n\\nBut most importantly today, I want to thank the American people.  Your faith and prayers have sustained me and inspired me through some very, very tough times.  All around America, I have met amazing people whose words of worship and encouragement have been a constant source of strength.  What I hear most often as I travel the country are five words that never, ever fail to touch my heart.  That’s:  “I am praying for you.”  I hear it so often — “I am praying for you, Mr. President.”  \\n\\nNo one has inspired me more in my travels than the families of the United States military, men and women who have put their lives on the line every day for their country and their countrymen.  I just came back yesterday from Dover Air Force Base to join the family of Chief William “Ryan” Owens, as America’s fallen hero was returned home.  Very, very sad, but very, very beautiful.  Very, very beautiful.  His family was there.  Incredible family, loved him so much.  So devastated — he was so devastated.  But the ceremony was amazing.  He died in defense of our nation.  He gave his life in defense of our people.  Our debt to him and our debt to his family is eternal and everlasting.\\n“Greater love hath no man than this: that a man lay down his life for his friends.”  We will never forget the men and women who wear the uniform, believe me.  \\n  Thank you.  From generation to generation, their vigilance has kept our liberty alive.  Our freedom is won by their sacrifice, and our security has been earned with their sweat and blood and tears.  God has blessed this land to give us such incredible heroes and patriots.  They are very, very special, and we are going to take care of them.  \\n\\nOur soldiers understand that what matters is not party or ideology or creed, but the bonds of loyalty that link us all together as one.  America is a nation of believers.  In towns all across our land, it’s plain to see what we easily forget — so easily we forget this — that the quality of our lives is not defined by our material success, but by our spiritual success.  I will tell you that.  And I tell you that from somebody that has had material success and knows tremendous numbers of people with great material success — the most material success.  Many of those people are very, very miserable, unhappy people.  And I know a lot of people without that, but they have great families, they have great faith.  They don’t have money — at least not nearly to the extent — and they’re happy.  Those to me are the successful people, I have to tell you.  \\n\\nI was blessed to be raised in a churched home.  My mother and father taught me that to whom much is given much is expected.  I was sworn in on the very bible from which my mother would teach us as young children.  And that faith lives on in my heart every single day.\\nThe people in this room come from many, many backgrounds.  You represent so many religions and so many views.  But we are all united by our faith in our Creator and our firm knowledge that we are all equal in His eyes.  We are not just flesh and bone and blood.  We are human beings, with souls.  Our Republic was formed on the basis that freedom is not a gift from government, but that freedom is a gift from God.  \\n\\nIt was the great Thomas Jefferson who said, “The God who gave us life, gave us liberty.”  Jefferson asked, “Can the liberties of a nation be secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of God?”\\nAmong those freedoms is the right to worship according to our own beliefs.  That is why I will get rid of, and totally destroy, the Johnson Amendment and allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution.  I will do that — remember.  \\n\\nFreedom of religion is a sacred right, but it is also a right under threat all around us, and the world is under serious, serious threat in so many different ways.  And I’ve never seen it so much and so openly as since I took the position of President.  The world is in trouble, but we’re going to straighten it out.  Okay?  That’s what I do.  I fix things.  We’re going to straighten it out.  \\n  Believe me.  When you hear about the tough phone calls I’m having, don’t worry about it.  Just don’t worry about it.  \\n  They’re tough.  We have to be tough.  It’s time we’re going to be a little tough, folks.  We’re taken advantage of by every nation in the world, virtually.  It’s not going to happen anymore.  It’s not going to happen anymore.\\nWe have seen unimaginable violence carried out in the name of religion.  Acts of wanton slaughter against religious minorities.  Horrors on a scale that defy description.  Terrorism is a fundamental threat to religious freedom.  It must be stopped, and it will be stopped.  It may not be pretty for a little while.  It will be stopped.  \\n\\nWe have seen — and, by the way, General, as you know, James “Mad Dog” — I shouldn’t say it in this room — Mattis.  Now, there’s a reason they call him “Mad Dog Mattis” — he never lost a battle.  Always wins them and always wins them fast.  He’s our new Secretary of Defense who will be working with Rex.  He’s right now in South Korea, going to Japan, going to some other spots.  And I’ll tell you what, I’ve gotten to know him really well.  He’s the real deal.  We have somebody who’s the real deal working for us, and that’s what we need.  So, you watch.  You just watch.  \\n  Things will be different.\\nWe have seen peace-loving Muslims brutalized, victimized, murdered and oppressed by ISIS killers.  We have seen threats of extermination against the Jewish people.  We have seen a campaign of ISIS and genocide against Christians, where they cut off heads.  Not since the Middle Ages have we seen that.  We haven’t seen that, the cutting off of heads.  Now they cut off their heads, they drown people in steel cages.  Haven’t seen this — I haven’t seen this.  Nobody has seen this for many, many years.\\nAll nations have a moral obligation to speak out against such violence.  All nations have a duty to work together to confront it and to confront it viciously, if we have to.  So I want to express clearly today to the American people that my administration will do everything in its power to defend and protect religious liberty in our land.  America must forever remain a tolerant society where all faiths are respected, and where all of our citizens can feel safe and secure.  We have to feel safe and secure.\\nIn recent days, we have begun to take necessary action to achieve that goal.  Our nation has the most generous immigration system in the world.  But these are those and there are those that would exploit that generosity to undermine the values that we hold so dear.  We need security.  There are those who would seek to enter our country for the purpose of spreading violence or oppressing other people based upon their faith or their lifestyle.  Not right.  We will not allow a beachhead of intolerance to spread in our nation.  You look all over the world and you see what’s happening.\\nSo in the coming days, we will develop a system to help ensure that those admitted into our country fully embrace our values of religious and personal liberty, and that they reject any form of oppression and discrimination.  We want people to come into our nation, but we want people to love us and to love our values — not to hate us and to hate our values.  We will be a safe country.  We will be a free country.  And we will be a country where all citizens can practice their beliefs without fear of hostility or fear of violence.  America will flourish as long as our liberty and, in particular, our religious liberty is allowed to flourish.  \\n\\nAmerica will succeed as long as our most vulnerable citizens — and we have some that are so vulnerable — have a path to success.  And America will thrive as long as we continue to have faith in each other and faith in God.  \\n\\nThat faith in God has inspired men and women to sacrifice for the needy, to deploy to wars overseas, and to lock arms at home, to ensure equal rights for every man, woman and child in our land.  It’s that faith that sent the pilgrims across the oceans, the pioneers across the plains, and the young people all across America to chase their dreams.  They are chasing their dreams.  We are going to bring those dreams back.  As long as we have God, we are never, ever alone.  Whether it’s the soldier on the night watch or the single parent on the night shift, God will always give us solace and strength and comfort.\\nWe need to carry on and to keep carrying on.  For us here in Washington, we must never, ever stop asking God for the wisdom to serve the public according to his will.  That’s why — (applause) — thank you.  That’s why President Eisenhower and Senator Carlson had the wisdom to gather together 64 years ago to begin this truly great tradition.  But that’s not all they did together.  Let me tell you the rest of the story.  Just one year later, Senator Carlson was among the members of Congress to send to the President’s desk a joint resolution that added “under God” to our Pledge of Allegiance.  That’s a great thing.  \\n  Because that’s what we are and that is what we will always be, and that is what our people want:  one beautiful nation, under God.\\nThank you.  God bless you.  And God bless America.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  \\n\\n')]\n"
